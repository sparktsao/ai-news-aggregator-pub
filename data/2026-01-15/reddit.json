      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nToday, I am announcing Soprano 1.1! I’ve designed it for massively improved stability and audio quality over the original model. \n\nWhile many of you were happy with the quality of Soprano, it had a tendency to start, well, *Mongolian throat singing*. Contrary to its name, Soprano is **NOT** supposed to be for singing, so I have reduced the frequency of these hallucinations by **95%**. Soprano 1.1-80M also has a **50%** lower WER than Soprano-80M, with comparable clarity to much larger models like Chatterbox-Turbo and VibeVoice. In addition, it now supports sentences up to **30 seconds** long, up from 15.\n\nThe outputs of Soprano could sometimes have a lot of artifacting and high-frequency noise.
