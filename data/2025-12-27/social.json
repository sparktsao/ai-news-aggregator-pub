      "content": "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession.

      "content": "@karpathy I feel this way most weeks tbh. Sometimes I start approaching a problem manually, and have to remind myself “claude can probably do this”. Recently we were debugging a memory leak in Claude Code, and I started approaching it the old fashioned way: connecting a profiler, using the app, pausing the profiler, manually looking through heap allocations. My coworker was looking at the same issue, and just asked Claude to make a heap dump, then read the dump to look for retained objects that probably shouldn’t be there; Claude 1-shotted it and put up a PR. The same thing happens most weeks.\n\nIn a way, newer coworkers and even new grads that don’t make all sorts of assumptions about what the model can and can’t do — legacy memories formed when using old models — are able to use the model most effectively. It takes significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two, as models continue to become better and better at coding and engineering.\n\nThe last month was my first month as an engineer that I didn’t open an IDE at all. Opus 4.5 wrote around 200 PRs, every single line. Software engineering is radically changing, and the hardest part even for early adopters and practitioners like us is to continue to re-adjust our expectations. And this is *still* just the beginning.",

      "content": "@krislipman I've been thinking more about that. There are actually 20 companies working with Niantic to build a world model or map with one-voxel-per-millimeter resolution. It is incredibly fine-grained. Once you map a street into voxels, as soon as the camera can see enough of a pattern in those voxels, it knows exactly where it is. This technology will be in phones and cars by next year.\n\nTesla currently has the best voxel map of the world—better than Niantic's—and it is more up-to-date because they have so many cars driving around, creating a real-time map.\n\nThis is crucial for difficult conditions:\n1. If a car is in a snowstorm and loses its main sensor, it can still use other inputs. Even if the rear camera is covered by snow (as it was in my case), you still have four side cameras and an interior camera.\n2. Even the interior camera can sometimes see landmarks, like a skyscraper through the back window, allowing the car to calculate its exact position in 3D space as it identifies more objects.\n3. On a clear day, this is easy, but in a heavy blizzard, visibility is obviously limited.\n\nYour idea of watching other cars is a great way to keep the system safer. It would reduce error rates over time for the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), which tracks directionality, bumps, and heading. There are also sensors on each wheel to monitor for slip.\n\nWhile a microphone won't help much in a snowstorm, the main goals are:\n* Seeing the red lights of the truck in front of you\n* Tracking the movement direction of other vehicles\n* Finding any evidence of lane markings via the side cameras\n\nIt will be interesting to see how they fully solve this. It seems straightforward in a straight line, but a curvy canyon road in a snowstorm is more complicated. Still, the same idea applies: if you can see a car in front of you and where they are on the road, you can tell if they are entering a turn. Other cars are definitely a vital data point—especially if one wrecks, which tells the system it needs to slow down and stop. It's a lot of fun to think about.",

A major new algorithmic change is coming, and until that happens, I'm not going to get too excited.\n\nIt's a real problem that you bring up: the algorithm tends to go superficial very quickly because most people are superficial. If you have armies of superficial people all clicking on and engaging with superficial posts, that's what the algorithm is going to show more people. Until the new algorithm is active, I don't see any fixes coming, so I'm just biding my time and watching this play out.\n\nTo some of the points you made:\n1. Effort does not get you reach, unfortunately.\n2. Credibility gets you reach.\n3. Having a little bit of engagement farming gets you reach in a variety of ways.\n\nThe game is tiring, but it is the game.

I have mapped out the entire AI industry here on X—about 37,000 people and 7,600 companies—along with tens of thousands of others in the tech industry. I have the most complete list on X of its kind. I also wrote books about social media before X started 19 years ago and have been tracking all of this through personal relationships and by attending many demo events and other gatherings around the world this past year.\n\nThe thing that is going to change this next year is the algorithm. That algorithm is going to radically change how PR is done because certain people will be winners in this new world, and certain people will lose and not get as much reach.\n\nReach really isn't the game; it's conversations and community. Some companies understand that deeply, but many do not. If you look through my list here on X, you'll see that I have about 9,000 CEOs and founders of AI companies. Very few of them do a good job of keeping the focus on their company and trying to find either investors or customers. \n\nYour post caught my eye because it's right on. It will be interesting to see the shifts over the next few months as the new algorithm turns on.",

Gaussian displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities from a young age. His work laid the foundation for numerous areas of mathematics and science, and his influence is still felt today. Gauss's prodigious talent was evident early on. By the age of three years, he was a prodigy. His formal education began at the age of seven, and he quickly surpassed his peers. Recognizing his potential, the Duke of Brunswick sponsored his education, allowing Gauss to attend the Collegium Carolinum and later the University of Göttingen. During his time at university, Gauss made several groundbreaking discoveries, including the construction of a regular 17-sided polygon using only a compass and straightedge, a feat that had eluded mathematicians for centuries.\n\nContributions to Mathematics\n\nGaussian’s contributions to mathematics are vast and varied, spanning several key areas:\n\nNumber Theory: Gauss's work in number theory is perhaps his most celebrated. His book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801, is a seminal work that systematized number theory and introduced several important concepts, including modular arithmetic and the notion of congruence. He also proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root.\n\nStatistics and Probability: Gauss made significant contributions to statistics, particularly in the development of the method of least squares, which is used to minimize the differences between observed and predicted values. This method is fundamental in statistical regression analysis. The Gaussian distribution, or normal distribution, is named after him and is a cornerstone of probability theory and statistics.\n\nGeometry and Differential Geometry: Gauss's work in geometry includes the development of the Gaussian curvature, a concept that measures the intrinsic curvature of a surface. His Theorema Egregium (\"Remarkable Theorem\") demonstrated that curvature is an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its embedding in three-dimensional space. This work laid the groundwork for the later development of differential geometry.\n\nAstronomy and Physics: Gauss applied his mathematical genius to astronomy, predicting the position of the dwarf planet Ceres using his method of least squares. His work in physics includes contributions to the study of magnetism, where he developed the Gauss's law for magnetism, Maxwell's equations that form the foundation of classical electromagnetism.\n\nComplex Analysis: Gauss made significant contributions to complex analysis, particularly in the theory of complex numbers. He was rigorously defined complex numbers and their operations, and he contributed to the understanding of functions of a complex variable.\n\nLegacy and Impact\n\nGauss's influence extends beyond his specific contributions to mathematics and science. His rigorous approach to problem-solving and his ability to synthesize disparate areas of mathematics have inspired generations of mathematicians. Many mathematical concepts, theorems, and terms bear his name, including Gaussian elimination, Gaussian integers, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.\nIn addition to his mathematical prowess, Gauss was known for his humility and dedication to his work. He continued to contribute to mathematics and science until his death on February 23, 1855. His legacy is preserved not only in the numerous concepts and theorems named after him but also in the continued relevance of his work in modern mathematics and science.\n\nIn conclusion, Gauss was a towering figure in the history of mathematics. His mathematics, is known as, ‘Gaussian.’ His contributions have had a profound and lasting impact on a wide range of fields, from number theory and statistics to geometry and physics. \n\nReferences\n\nGauss: Titan of Science by G.
