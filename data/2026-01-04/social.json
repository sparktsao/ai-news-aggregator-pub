It was explicitly described as a \"Facebook clone\" or \"pixel-to-pixel copy\" in numerous reports from the era.\n\nAfter being acquired in 2006 and rebranded to Renren (meaning \"everyone's network\") in 2009 to broaden its appeal, it became known as \"China's Facebook\" or the \"failed Chinese Facebook.\" It gained massive popularity among students and young users, especially after Facebook was blocked in China in 2009, but later declined with the rise of mobile apps like WeChat and Weibo.\n\nWhile other platforms like Kaixin001 also competed in the social networking space (often with similar games and features), Renren/Xiaonei is consistently cited as the earliest and most direct early-days copy of Facebook's model.",
