      "content": "RLHF Book status update: lot's of great changes.\n\nOver the past month I've been doing a top to bottom update to the RLHF book. All of these changes are reflected on the website rlhfbook dot com, and will soon be translated to the Manning early access version (MEAP), and then more improvements for the physical copy.\n\nOverall, this took the PDF from ~150 to ~200 pages, the book is much more well rounded now.\n\nSome of the larger changes:\n\n- Updates to the RL chapter to add more algorithms like GSPO, CISPO, etc. \n- Updated the big table of reasoning model tech reports (full list below). Added a section on Rubrics for RLVR. \n- Updated the text in many chapters to better reflect best practices of today.\n- Many clarity fixes throughout, adding better transitions, introductions, etc.\n- More consistent notation throughout the book.\n\nI strongly recommend taking a look again if you only looked in the first half of 2025. There are also many surprising details, such as fixing this attached RLHF system diagram you may recognize from my first HuggingFace RLHF blog post in December of 2022, it had a bunch of minor errors.\n\nNext step I'm going to be focusing on making the physical Manning book great. The content will flow more smoothly than the web version (i'm trying to not change the links), such as linking the constitutional AI and synthetic data chapters. Overall this should make it read better from front to back. Also, all the diagrams and content will be designed to have a much more elegant presentation. \n\nThanks for reading and feedback!",

For years, Data Shapley has been the theoretically sound way to attribute value to training data, but nobody could use it on anything larger than toy models because it required retraining on exponentially many data subsets.\n\nThis work shows you can get Shapley values during a single training run by decomposing the attribution problem into per-iteration contributions and computing them efficiently through clever manipulation of gradients during backpropagation.\n\nBeyond the technical contribution, the empirical findings show that around 16% of the already-curated Pile dataset has negative contribution; removing it speeds up training by 25%.\n\nRead online and ask questions when blocked: https://t.co/2an5LXCeyI\n\nDownload a PDF: https://t.co/5yDEM94Isq",

      "content": "One of the fundamental papers that advanced our understanding of deep neural networks and led to the AI that we have today.\n\nAt the time, researchers struggled with training neural networks with even two hidden layers (the weights between the input and the output of the neural networks). The problem was that the gradient signal didn't reach the weights closer to the input, which prevented the neural network from learning how to encode the inputs into something meaningful.\n\nAmong the most important discoveries that allowed training deep networks was Xavier initialization (named after the paper's first author, Xavier Glorot).\n\nThe key insight: if weights are initialized with the wrong variance, signals either explode or vanish as they pass through layers\u2014in both directions (forward activations and backward gradients).\n\nTheir solution was elegantly simple: initialize weights from a uniform distribution scaled by both the input and output layer sizes.\n\nThis keeps the variance of activations and gradients roughly constant across layers, allowing learning signals to flow through the entire network.\n\nThe paper also showed why sigmoid activations were problematic (their non-zero mean pushes outputs toward saturation), paving the way for tanh and later ReLU dominance.\n\nPublished in 2010, this work\u2014alongside He initialization (2015) for ReLU networks\u2014became foundational to training the deep networks that power modern AI.\n\nRead by asking clarifying questions: https://t.co/IakAN1rZJu\n\nDownload PDF: https://t.co/60R0Bl2Ce0",

      "content": "Gemini:\nThe single best investment is an official 1297 exemplification (copy) of the Magna Carta.\n1. The Investment: 1297 Magna Carta Exemplification\nIn 1300, the Magna Carta was not an ancient relic but an active legal statute. King Edward I had issued a confirmation (inspeximus) of the Charter in 1297. You could acquire an official copy from the Royal Chancery or a highly skilled scrivener.\n * The Asset: A single parchment sheet inscribed with the Magna Carta, bearing the royal seal (or the seal of the Chancery).\n * The Value Today: In 2007, a 1297 Magna Carta (the \"Brudenell\" copy) sold at Sotheby's for $21.3 million.\n * The Return on Investment: Approximately 2,000,000% (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power).\n2. Can You Afford It? ($1,000 Budget Analysis)\nYes, but barely. We must convert your $1,000 (2026 USD) into 1300 purchasing power:\n * Gold Standard: $1,000 USD (2026) is roughly equivalent to 0.3\u20130.4 oz of gold.\n * 1300 Currency: This equals approximately 3 to 3.5 Florentine Gold Florins.\n * Exchange Rate: In 1300, 1 Gold Florin was worth roughly 6 shillings (s).\n * Total Budget: You have roughly 18 to 21 shillings (~\u00a31).\n * Cost of the Item: Administrative fees for royal writs and charters typically ranged from a \"mark\" (13s 4d) to \u00a31, depending on the complexity. Since you are requesting a copy of an existing statute, the cost would be primarily the scribe's labor and the sealing fee. With ~20 shillings, you have just enough to pay the Chancery fees for one high-quality, official document.\n3. The Strategy: \"The Institutional Trust\"\nYou cannot bury this (it will rot) or hide it (it will be lost). You must use the only entities that have survived 700 years of war: The Church or The University.\n * Action: Take your fresh Magna Carta to Durham Cathedral (founded 1093) or Westminster Abbey.\n * The Deal: Deposit the document in the Cathedral Priory's archives under a \"Deed of Deposit\" (not a gift). Frame it as a holy relic of the law, entrusted to the church for safekeeping for your \"descendants.\"\n * Why It Survives:\n   * Durham Cathedral has never been sacked or burned down since 1300. Its library has maintained continuous records for nearly a millennium.\n   * Even during the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1539), Durham's priory was simply converted into a secular chapter; the books and charters remained on the shelves.\n   * During the English Civil War and WWII, these archives were protected as national heritage.\n4. Why This Beats Other Investments\n| Investment | 1300 Cost | 2026 Status | Why it Fails/Loses |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| London Real Estate | ~\u00a32 - \u00a350 | Billions | Failed: You cannot afford the freehold (\u00a32+) with your \u00a31 budget. Even if you bought a lease, maintaining legal title through the Black Death (1348) and Great Fire (1666) without being present is legally impossible. |\n| Stora Enso Shares | >\u00a310 | Stock | Failed: While the company (copper mine) existed in 1288, a share (1/8th of the mine) cost far more than 3 Florins. Furthermore, share dilution and mergers over 700 years would likely wipe out your equity. |\n| Giotto Painting | ~5-10 Florins | $50M+ | Risky: A panel by Giotto (active 1300) is a great candidate, but slightly out of your budget. Art is also easier to loot, burn, or re-attribute than a stamped royal charter. |\n| Magna Carta | ~1 Mark (13s 4d) | $21.3M | Winner: Verified market value, durable material (parchment), protected by lawyers and clerics, distinct \"brand\" recognition. |\n5. Summary\nBy spending your 18 shillings (approx. $1000 2026 USD) on an official Chancery copy of the Magna Carta and depositing it in the archives of Durham Cathedral, you utilize the stability of English ecclesiastical record-keeping to bypass wars and revolutions. You are creating a verifiable chain of custody that turns a modest administrative fee into a $21.3 million asset.\nSources",

      "content": "ChatGPT: \n\nBuy a documented ownership share in the Great Copper Mountain at Falun (Stora Kopparberg), Sweden\n\nWhy this is the best candidate that actually clears your survivability rule\n\nThis isn\u2019t just \u201cbuy land and hope.\u201d Falun is one of the rare cases where we have (a) medieval-era documentary evidence, (b) an early share-like ownership structure, and (c) continuity into a modern successor company.\n\nKey points, with sources:\n\u2022The Great Copper Mountain (Falun) has surviving documentation from 1288 and a major charter dated 1347.  \n\u2022That charter-era operation is described by ICOMOS (UNESCO\u2019s advisory body) as being organized \u201cas a corporate operation\u201d where free miners (bergsm\u00e4n) owned shares (\u201cfj\u00e4rdeparter\u201d) proportional to their interests\u2014explicitly calling it a precursor to later joint-stock companies and noting it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe oldest company in the world.\u201d  \n\u2022The Swedish History Museum describes the medieval bergslag business organizations (from the 13th century onward) where members owned shares of a mine or smelting furnace\u2014i.e., a real, historically grounded \u201cequity-like\u201d structure you can buy into around 1300.  \n\u2022There is a well-known 1288 share document associated with the mine (a share entitling the holder to 1/8 of the Great Copper Mine), and the Wikimedia description notes the original is in Sweden\u2019s National Archives (Riksarkivet) with a copy in the Stora Enso archive in Falun.  \n\u2022ICOMOS describes the enterprise\u2019s later evolution: it notes the \u201cold company\u201d was reconstituted as a modern limited company in 1888 (Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB).  \n\u2022Stora Enso itself (the modern, publicly traded successor through corporate evolution/merger) explicitly dates its first recorded documentation to 1288 copper mining near Falun, notes progression to Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag, and states Stora Enso was formed in 1998 via merger.  \n\u2022A mainstream historical write-up (LA Times) also recounts the famous 1288 transaction (a bishop trading property for a one\u2011eighth interest), framing it as a basis for the \u201coldest continuously operating company\u201d claim.  \n\nWhy this is unusually robust against \u201cregime change risk\u201d\n\nTo meet your \u201c90% chance\u201d requirement, you want something that is not dependent on a single dynasty, a single city-state\u2019s solvency, or an easily confiscated stash of precious metal.\n\nFalun/Stora Kopparberg has a few structural advantages versus the usual time-travel answers:\n1.The underlying asset is a productive resource (a major mining complex) with deep economic importance over centuries, not just a paper claim on a government that might default. ICOMOS emphasizes its enormous economic significance and long influence.  \n2.There is evidence of institutional continuity across centuries (medieval documents \u2192 charter structure \u2192 modern corporate form \u2192 successor company history still tracked today).  \n3.The ownership model was share-based early on, which is exactly what you want if the goal is \u201cone investment that can survive\u201d rather than a pile of valuables you\u2019d have to conceal.  \n\nIs \u201c90%\u201d provable? Not in a literal actuarial sense\u2014history doesn\u2019t give clean probabilities. But if your standard is \u201cpick the option with the strongest real-world track record of surviving for ~700+ years,\u201d this is about as close as you can get while staying within your rules.\n\nWhat \u201cspending $1000 (2026 USD)\u201d means in practice\n\nIn 1300 you can\u2019t hand someone modern dollars, so the practical equivalent is: you arrive with ~$1000 worth of widely recognized value (e.g., precious metal by weight), then convert that into the local transaction form to purchase a fractional mine share / share-right within the bergslag system.\n\nThe investment is the legally recognized share of a productive enterprise\u2014not a hidden hoard.",

      "content": "Claude\u2019s answer:\n\n## The Best Investment: A Contribution to an Islamic Waqf Endowment\n\n**My recommendation: Contribute $1,000 (2026 USD equivalent) to an established Islamic waqf endowment, specifically to a major educational or charitable institution like Al-Azhar in Cairo or the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez.**\n\n-----\n\n### Converting $1,000 (2026 USD) to 1300 Currency\n\nA laborer earned \u00a32 a year in 1300, which means  40 shillings, or 480 pence a year \u2013 or 2 pence a day. Using historical purchasing power comparisons and the fact that Crown revenues (at peace) were \u00a330,000 circa 1300, and Barons earned \u00a3200-500+ per year , your $1,000 would translate to approximately **10-16 shillings** (120-192 silver pennies) in 1300.\n\nThis could buy you:\n\n- A cottage (1 bay, 2 storeys) for \u00a32 in early 14th century  - so you\u2019d have roughly 25-40% of a small cottage\n- Rent for a cottage at 5s/year  - about 2-3 years of cottage rent\n- Several sheep or livestock\n\n-----\n\n### Why Islamic Waqf Beats All Other Options\n\n**1. Legal Protection Unmatched in History**\n\nA waqf is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. It typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets. \n\nCritically, the inviolability of the waqf arrangement has traditionally provided security for the assets, which cannot be sold to pay a debt, be confiscated by a government that subscribes to Islamic law, or be used beyond their designated purpose. \n\n**2. Proven 700+ Year Survival Record**\n\nUnder the Mamluks, Al-Azhar gained influence and rose in prestige. The Mamluks established salaries for instructors and stipends for the students and gave the institution an endowment. A college was built for the institution in 1340, outside of the mosque. \n\nThis is precisely the era you\u2019d be investing in - and Al-Azhar still operates today as one of the world\u2019s most prestigious Islamic institutions, having survived the Mongol invasions, Crusades, Ottoman conquest, Napoleonic invasion, British colonialism, and modern revolutions.\n\n**3. Multiple Waqf Institutions from the 1300s Still Function**\n\nThe Al-Nuri Hospital, which operated for some 700 years, was the same hospital where Al-Mansur Qalawun was treated and inspired to establish his own hospital in Cairo.  The Bimaristan al-Nuri was founded in 1156 CE and operated continuously for centuries.\n\nThe Al-Mansuri Hospital was substantial, both in size and endowments. This hospital had the capability of holding 8000 beds and was funded off of annual endowments totaling one million dirhams\u2026 The Al-Mansuri Hospital remained operational through the 15th century CE and still stands in Cairo today, though it is now known as \u201cMustashfa Qalawun.\u201d \n\n-----\n\n### Why Other Options Fail the 90% Survival Test\n\n**Land in Europe:**\n\n- English land faced confiscation during the Wars of the Roses, Reformation, Civil War, and Enclosure Acts\n- The Statutes of Mortmain of 1279 and 1290 were designed to prevent land from falling into the \u201cdead hand\u201d of the church, and thus depriving the Crown of future revenue. \n\n**Religious foundations in Christian Europe:**\n\n- Massive destruction during the Reformation (1530s) - Henry VIII dissolved thousands of monasteries, almshouses, and charitable foundations\n\n**Early bonds/financial instruments:**\n\n- The lives of perpetual loans typically were \u201ccut short by imprudent financing, government recall, or the misfortunes of wars and revolutions.\u201d \n- The oldest bond that is still paying interest is one issued in 1624  - over 300 years after your target date, and even these are exceptionally rare survivors\n\n-----",

      "content": "@rywalker @rmcentush The problem with your statement is that there are always advantages to centralization. Nerds like to hang out with other nerds; I hear this over and over again as the reason they don't leave the San Francisco Bay Area. They want to have smart neighbors who work in tech because it makes things more interesting at parties and cafes. If you come here, you'll see this firsthand. The serendipity of this area is unparalleled in the world, and that is why we love living here.\n\nBut look at Y Combinator:\n1. It is a factory of startups\u2014a centralized factory.\n2. It only does well when everyone is together and can pitch 3,000 investors at the end of the class.\n\nThat is the whole point of Y Combinator and the startup ecosystem that now exists in San Francisco. Y Combinator has been copied by quite a few other rich people who have their own little \"startup residencies,\" as they call them.\n\nIf those people leave, the whole thing leaves. While there is no reason Y Combinator specifically needs to be in San Francisco, it does need to be centralized in a city. Whoever ends up with Y Combinator is going to see a startup ecosystem start to grow around them. But of course, as pointed out elsewhere, you can't get everybody to move\u2014and so we're just being squeezed, and we don't like it.",
