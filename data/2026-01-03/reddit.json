      "title": "Claude Code creator Boris shares his setup with 13 detailed steps,full details below",
      "content": "I'm Boris and I created **Claude Code.** Lots of people have asked how I use Claude Code, so I wanted to show off my setup a bit.\n\nMy **setup might be surprisingly vanilla.** Claude Code works great out of the box, so I personally don't customize it much. \n\n**There is no one correct way to use Claude Code:** we intentionally build it in a way that you can use it, customize it and hack it however you like. Each person on the Claude Code team uses it very differently. So, here goes.\n\n1) I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal. I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input\n\n\ud83d\udd17:\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config#iterm-2-system-notifications\n\n2) I also run 5-10 Claudes on claude.ai/code, in parallel with my local Claudes. As I **code** in my terminal, I will often hand off local sessions to web (using &amp;), **or** manually kick off sessions in Chrome, and sometimes I will --teleport back and forth. I also start a few sessions from my phone (from the Claude iOS app) every morning and throughout the day, and check in on them later.\n\n3) I use **Opus 4.5 with thinking** for everything. It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to **steer** it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.\n\n4) Our team **shares** a single CLAUDE.md for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week. Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude **knows** not to do it next time.\n\nOther teams **maintain** their own CLAUDE.md's. It is each team's job to keep theirs up to date.\n\n5) During code review, I will **often** tag @.claude on my coworkers' PRs to add something to the CLAUDE.md as part of the PR. We use the Claude Code Github action (/install-github-action) for this. It's our version of @danshipper's Compounding Engineering\n\n6) Most sessions **start** in Plan mode (shift+tab twice). If my goal is to write a Pull Request, I will use Plan mode, and go back and forth with Claude until I like its plan. From there, I **switch** into auto-accept edits mode and Claude can usually 1-shot it. A good plan is really important.\n\n7) I use **slash** commands for every \"inner loop\" workflow that I end up doing many times a day. This saves me from repeated prompting, and makes it so Claude can use these workflows, too. Commands are checked into git and live in .claude/commands/.\n\n**For example,** Claude and I use a /commit-push-pr slash command dozens of times every day. The command **uses** inline bash to pre-compute git status and a few other pieces of info to make the command run quickly and avoid back-and-forth with the model \n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#bash-command-execution\n\n8) I use a few subagents regularly: code-simplifier simplifies the **code after** Claude is done working, verify-app has detailed instructions for testing Claude Code end to end, and so on. **Similar** to slash commands, I think of subagents as automating the most common workflows that I do for most PRs.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents\n\n9) We use a **PostToolUse hook** to format Claude's code. Claude usually generates well-formatted code out of the box, and the hook handles the last 10% to avoid formatting errors in CI later.\n\n10) I **don't use** --dangerously-skip-permissions. Instead, I use /permissions to pre-allow common bash commands that I know are safe in my environment, to **avoid** unnecessary permission prompts. Most of these are checked into .claude/settings.json and shared with the team.\n\n11) Claude Code **uses** all my tools for me. It often searches and posts to Slack (via the MCP server), runs BigQuery queries to answer analytics questions (using bq CLI), grabs error logs from Sentry, etc. The Slack MCP configuration is checked into our .mcp.json and shared with the team.\n\n12) **For very long-running tasks,** I will either (a) prompt Claude to verify its work with a background agent when it's done, (b) use an agent Stop hook to do that more deterministically, or (c) use the ralph-wiggum plugin (originally dreamt up by @GeoffreyHuntley). \n\nI will also use either --permission-mode=dontAsk or --dangerously-skip-permissions in a sandbox to avoid permission prompts for the session, so Claude can cook without being blocked on me.\n\n\ud83d\udd17:\nhttps://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins%2Fralph-wiggum\n\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide\n\n13) **A final tip:** probably the most important thing to get great results out of Claude Code -- give Claude a way to verify its work. If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result.\n\nClaude tests **every single change** I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.\n\nVerification looks **different** for each domain. It might be as simple as running a bash command, or running a test suite, or testing the app in a browser or phone simulator. Make sure to invest in making this rock-solid.\n\n\ud83d\udd17: code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome\n\n~&gt; **I hope this was helpful - Boris**\n\n**Images order:**\n\n1) **Step_1** (Image-2)\n\n2) **Step_2** (Image-3)\n\n3) **Step_4** (Image-4)\n\n4) **Step_5** (Image-5)\n\n5) **Step_6** (Image-6)\n\n6) **Step_7** (Image-7)\n\n7) **Step_8** (Image-8)\n\n8) **Step_9** (Image-9)\n\n9) **Step_10** (Image-10)\n\n10) **Step_11** (Image-11)\n\n11) **Step_12** (Image-12)\n\n\n**Source: Boris Cherny in X**\n\n\ud83d\udd17: https://x.com/i/status/2007179832300581177",

      "content": "# The Context\n\nSince ResNet (2015), the Residual Connection (x\\_{l+1} = x\\_l + F(x\\_l)) has been the untouchable backbone of deep learning (from CNN to Transformer, from BERT to GPT). It solves the vanishing gradient problem by providing an \"identity mapping\" fast lane. For 10 years, almost no one questioned it.\n\n# The Problem\n\nHowever, this standard design forces a rigid 1:1 ratio between the input and the new computation, preventing the model from dynamically adjusting how much it relies on past layers versus new information.\n\n# The Innovation\n\nByteDace tried to break this rule with \"Hyper-Connections\" (HC), allowing the model to learn the connection weights instead of using a fixed ratio.\n\n* **The potential:** Faster convergence and better performance due to flexible information routing.\n* **The issue:** It was incredibly unstable. Without constraints, signals were amplified by **3000x** in deep networks, leading to exploding gradients.\n\n# The Solution: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC)\n\nIn their new paper, DeepSeek solved the instability by constraining the learnable matrices to be \"Double Stochastic\" (all elements \u2267 0, rows/cols sum to 1).\n\nMathematically, this forces the operation to act as a weighted average (convex combination). It guarantees that signals are never amplified beyond control, regardless of network depth.\n\n# The Results\n\n* **Stability:** Max gain magnitude dropped from **3000 to 1.6** (3 orders of magnitude improvement).\n* **Performance:** mHC beats both the standard baseline and the unstable HC on benchmarks like GSM8K and DROP.\n* **Cost:** Only adds \\~6% to training time due to heavy optimization (kernel fusion).\n\n# Why it matters\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ybux3x1wgyag1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daafe17d3a61d387adf952ad756eb70af3bc445f\n\nAs hinted in the attached tweet, we are seeing a fascinating split in the AI world. While the industry frenzy focuses on commercialization and AI Agents\u2014exemplified by Meta spending $2 Billion to acquire Manus\u2014labs like DeepSeek and Moonshot (Kimi) are playing a different game.\n\nDespite resource constraints, they are digging into the deepest levels of macro-architecture and optimization. They have the audacity to question what we took for granted: **Residual Connections** (challenged by DeepSeek's mHC) and **AdamW** (challenged by Kimi's Muon). Just because these have been the standard for 10 years doesn't mean they are the optimal solution.\n\nCrucially, instead of locking these secrets behind closed doors for commercial dominance, they are **open-sourcing** these findings for the advancement of humanity. This spirit of relentless self-doubt and fundamental reinvention is exactly how we evolve.",

      "content": "# The Context\n\nSince ResNet (2015), the Residual Connection (x\\_{l+1} = x\\_l + F(x\\_l)) has been the untouchable backbone of deep learning (from CNN to Transformer, from BERT to GPT). It solves the vanishing gradient problem by providing an \"identity mapping\" fast lane. For 10 years, almost no one questioned it.\n\n# The Problem\n\nHowever, this standard design forces a rigid 1:1 ratio between the input and the new computation, preventing the model from dynamically adjusting how much it relies on past layers versus new information.\n\n# The Innovation\n\nByteDace tried to break this rule with \"Hyper-Connections\" (HC), allowing the model to learn the connection weights instead of using a fixed ratio.\n\n* **The potential:** Faster convergence and better performance due to flexible information routing.\n* **The issue:** It was incredibly unstable. Without constraints, signals were amplified by **3000x** in deep networks, leading to exploding gradients.\n\n# The Solution: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC)\n\nIn their new paper, DeepSeek solved the instability by constraining the learnable matrices to be \"Double Stochastic\" (all elements \u2267 0, rows/cols sum to 1).\n\nMathematically, this forces the operation to act as a weighted average (convex combination). It guarantees that signals are never amplified beyond control, regardless of network depth.\n\n# The Results\n\n* **Stability:** Max gain magnitude dropped from **3000 to 1.6** (3 orders of magnitude improvement).\n* **Performance:** mHC beats both the standard baseline and the unstable HC on benchmarks like GSM8K and DROP.\n* **Cost:** Only adds \\~6% to training time due to heavy optimization (kernel fusion).\n\n# Why it matters\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng6ackbmhyag1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec60542ddac6d49f2f47acf6836f12bb18bf1614\n\nAs hinted in the attached tweet, we are seeing a fascinating split in the AI world. While the industry frenzy focuses on commercialization and AI Agents\u2014exemplified by Meta spending $2 Billion to acquire Manus\u2014labs like DeepSeek and Moonshot (Kimi) are playing a different game.\n\nDespite resource constraints, they are digging into the deepest levels of macro-architecture and optimization. They have the audacity to question what we took for granted: **Residual Connections** (challenged by DeepSeek's mHC) and **AdamW** (challenged by Kimi's Muon). Just because these have been the standard for 10 years doesn't mean they are the optimal solution.\n\nCrucially, instead of locking these secrets behind closed doors for commercial dominance, they are **open-sourcing** these findings for the advancement of humanity. This spirit of relentless self-doubt and fundamental reinvention is exactly how we evolve.",

      "content": "I'm tired of the \u201cthis model is SOTA\u201d claims for every new model recently from the 3 \"AI\" giants. The names are pretty obvious: Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic), GPT-5.2 Codex (OpenAI), and Gemini 3 Pro (Google).\n\nSo, I compared them on 2 real coding and agentic tasks in the same Next.js repo, using their CLIs (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI).\n\nWe're not really talking about the benchmarks, but more about real use and whether they can actually ship features in a real-world project. If so, how good or how bad do these turn out to be compared to each other?\n\nI've tracked time, token usage, and cost.\n\n&gt;**NOTE:** All these records are taken the best of three from each of the models so we're not evaluating based on an unlucky dice roll for any model.\n\nHere's the repository that's been used: [shricodev/kanban-ai-realtime-localization](https://github.com/shricodev/kanban-ai-realtime-localization)\n\n# Task 1: production feature in a real app\n\n* **Gemini 3 Pro** performed the best. It set up the fallback and cache effectively, with repeated generations returning in milliseconds from the cache. The run cost **$0.45**, took **7 minutes and 14 seconds**, and used about **746K input (including cache reads) + \\~11K output**.\n* **Claude Opus 4.5** was reliable but not flawless. It delivered something that built and passed tests, and it was close to the desired behavior, but there were still some issues with how the cache appeared in the UI. It cost **$2.21**, took **9 minutes and 11 seconds (API time)**, and changed **+1,122 / -36** lines.\n* **GPT-5.2 Codex** was the least dependable for this task. It encountered API/version mismatches, and the final feature didn't work smoothly. It cost about **$0.9**, took **7 minutes and 34 seconds (+55 seconds on tests)**, and reported **269,195 total tokens** (input **252,810** \\+ **1,560,192 cached** reads, output **16,385**, reasoning **8,704**).\n\n# Task 2: tool-powered agent build (GitHub triage demo)\n\n* **Claude Opus 4.5** was the only one that consistently got a full demo working. It could open a Tool Router session and return a real issue URL. However, it wasn't future-proof because it hardcoded tool names and had weak duplicate detection logic. This run cost **$2.88**, took **22 minutes and 46 seconds**, and changed **+1,176 / -294** lines.\n* **GPT-5.2 Codex** started off well but struggled with old Composio API usage. It even returned a 200 OK status for a request that failed completely. It ran for **5 minutes and 15 seconds (+20 seconds for an attempted fix)** with **201,382 total tokens** (input **186,265** \\+ **432,640 cached**, output **15,117**, reasoning **6,912**), and changed **+1,682 / -86** lines.\n* **Gemini 3 Pro** was the most unusual. It kept encountering a \"potential loop\" and stopped after long runs. It ended up being expensive because it used **12.6 million input+cache read** tokens for about **24,000 output**. This cost roughly **$6.3** and took around **30 minutes** in my typical run.\n\n&gt;\u2139\ufe0f **One extra note:** Claude Code (Opus) web-searches a lot, and approving tons of searches slowed the flow more than I expected.\n\nYou can find full breakdown with commits, and screenshots here: [Claude 4.5 Opus vs. Gemini 3 Pro vs. GPT-5.2-codex](https://composio.dev/blog/claude-4-5-opus-vs-gemini-3-pro-vs-gpt-5-codex-max-the-sota-coding-model)\n\nSo, here's my takeaway: At least from this test, I can conclude that you can\u2019t really expect a model to work great in projects like this, or even more complex ones, at least not right now.\n\nOpus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects.\n\nAnyone noticing Gemini loop on longer runs, because honestly this was so unexpected, and what model you're using as your daily driver?",

      "content": "The physical and digital architecture of the global **\"brain\"** officially hit a new gear. Prime Intellect has just unveiled **Recursive Language Models (RLMs)**, a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as a dynamic environment rather than a static window.\n\n**The End of \"Context Rot\":** LLMs have traditionally **struggled** with large context windows because of information loss (context rot). RLMs **solve** this by treating input data as a Python variable. \n\nThe **model** programmatically examines, partitions and recursively calls itself over specific snippets using a persistent Python REPL environment.\n\n**Key Breakthroughs from INTELLECT-3:**\n\n* **Context Folding:** Unlike standard RAG, the model never actually **summarizes** context, which leads to data loss. Instead, it pro-actively delegates specific tasks to sub-LLMs and Python scripts.\n\n* **Extreme Efficiency:** Benchmarks show that a wrapped **GPT-5-mini** using RLM **outperforms** a standard GPT-5 on long-context tasks while using less than 1/5th of the main context tokens.\n\n* **Long-Horizon Agency:** By managing **its** own context end-to-end via RL, the system can stay coherent over tasks spanning weeks or months.\n\n**Open Superintelligence:** Alongside this research, Prime Intellect released **INTELLECT-3**, a 106B MoE model (12B active) trained on their full RL stack. It matches the closed-source frontier performance while remaining fully transparent with **open weights.**\n\n**If models can now programmatically \"peak and grep\" their own prompts, is the brute-force scaling of context windows officially obsolete?**\n\n**Source:** [Prime Intellect Blog](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/rlm)\n\n**Paper:** [arXiv:2512.24601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)",

I'm not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.**\n\n&gt;LeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed.

      "content": "So Zipf's law is essentially a recognized phenomena that happens across a ton of areas, but most commonly language, where the most common thing is some amount more common than the second common thing, which is that amount more common than the third most common thing, etc etc.\n\nA practical example is words in books, where the most common word has twice the occurrences as the second most common word, which has twice the occurrences as the third most common word, all the way down.\n\nThis has also been observed in [language models outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12191). (This linked paper isn't the only example, nearly all LLMs adhere to zipf's law even more strictly than human written data.)\n\nMore recently, [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=knPz7gtjPW) came out, showing that LLMs inherently fall into power law scaling, not only as a result of human language, but by their architectural nature.\n\n  \nNow I'm an image model trainer/provider, so I don't care a ton about LLMs beyond that they do what I ask them to do. But, since this discovery about power law scaling in LLMs has implications for training them, I wanted to see if there is any close relation for image models.\n\nI found something pretty cool:\n\nIf you treat colors like the 'words' in the example above, and how many pixels of that color are in the image, human made images (artwork, photography, etc) DO NOT follow a zipfian distribution, but AI generated images (across several models I tested) DO follow a zipfian distribution.\n\nI only tested across some 'small' sets of images, but it was statistically significant enough to be interesting. I'd love to see a larger scale test.\n\n[Human made images \\(colors are X, frequency is Y\\)](https://preview.redd.it/11yo2g6w5yag1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c6629733852bbd9ea8f6b2d760f0a59f96f6df)\n\n[AI generated images \\(colors are X, frequency is Y\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fgutdv716yag1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64c3923ae45d664f4eb11b954a330311642be508)\n\nI suspect if you look at a more fundamental component of image models, you'll find a deeper reason for this and a connection to why LLMs follow similar patterns.\n\nWhat really sticks out to me here is how differently shaped the distributions of colors in the images is. This changes across image categories and models, but even Gemini (which has a more human shaped curve, with the slope, then hump at the end) still has a &lt;90% fit to a zipfian distribution.\n\n  \nAnyways there is my incomplete thought. It seemed interesting enough that I wanted to share.\n\n  \nWhat I still don't know:\n\nDoes training on images that closely follow a zipfian distribution create better image models?\n\nDoes this method hold up at larger scales?\n\nShould we try and find ways to make image models LESS zipfian to help with realism?",

      "content": "# Hello r/MachineLearning\n\nI've been building LEMMA, an open-source symbolic mathematics engine that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a learned policy network. The goal is to combine the rigor of symbolic computation with the intuition that neural networks can provide for rule selection.\n\n# The Problem\n\nLarge language models are impressive at mathematical reasoning, but they can produce plausible-looking proofs that are actually incorrect. Traditional symbolic solvers are sound but struggle with the combinatorial explosion of possible rule applications. LEMMA attempts to bridge this gap: every transformation is verified symbolically, but neural guidance makes search tractable by predicting which rules are likely to be productive.\n\n# Technical Approach\n\nThe core is a typed expression representation with about 220 transformation rules covering algebra, calculus, trigonometry, number theory, and inequalities. When solving a problem, MCTS explores the space of rule applications. A small transformer network (trained on synthetic derivations) provides prior probabilities over rules given the current expression, which biases the search toward promising branches.\n\nThe system is implemented in Rust (14k lines of Rust, no python dependencies for the core engine) Expression trees map well to Rust's enum types and pattern matching, and avoiding garbage collection helps with consistent search latency.\n\n# What It Can Solve\n\nAlgebraic Manipulation:\n\n* (x+1)\u00b2 - (x-1)\u00b2\u00a0\u2192\u00a04x \u00a0(expansion and simplification)\n* a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 \u00a0\u2192\u00a0(a-b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2)\u00a0(difference of cubes factorization)\n\nCalculus:\n\n* d/dx\\[x\u00b7sin(x)\\] \u00a0\u2192\u00a0sin(x) + x\u00b7cos(x)\u00a0(product rule)\n* \u222b e\\^x dx \u00a0\u2192\u00a0e\\^x + C \u00a0(integration)\n\nTrigonometric Identities:\n\n* sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) \u00a0\u2192\u00a01 \u00a0(Pythagorean identity)\n* sin(2x)\u00a0\u2192\u00a02\u00b7sin(x)\u00b7cos(x) \u00a0(double angle)\n\nNumber Theory:\n\n* gcd(a,b) \u00b7 lcm(a,b)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0|a\u00b7b| \u00a0(GCD-LCM relationship)\n* C(n,k) + C(n,k+1) \u00a0\u2192\u00a0C(n+1,k+1) \u00a0(Pascal's identity)\n\nInequalities:\n\n* Recognizes when\u00a0a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 \u2265 2ab \u00a0applies (AM-GM)\n* |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b| \u00a0(triangle inequality bounds)\n\nSummations:\n\n* \u03a3\\_{i=1}\\^{n} i \u00a0evaluates to closed form when bounds are concrete\n* Proper handling of bound variables and shadowing\n\n# Recent Additions\n\nThe latest version adds support for summation and product notation with proper bound variable handling, number theory primitives (GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic, factorials, binomial coefficients), and improved AM-GM detection that avoids interfering with pure arithmetic.\n\n# Limitations and Open Questions\n\nThe neural component is still small and undertrained.

      "content": "\n\n####TL;DR:\n\n**Recursive Language Models (RLMs) solve the problem of AI struggling to process extremely long documents by changing how the model reads information. Instead of trying to \"memorize\" an entire text at once\u2014which often causes errors or forgetfulness\u2014an RLM treats the text like a file in an external computer system that the AI can browse as needed.**\n\n**This method allows the AI to accurately handle millions of words (far beyond its normal capacity) while remaining efficient and cost-effective compared to standard approaches.**\n\n---\n\n\n####Abstract:\n\n&gt;We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query. \n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\nRecursive Language Models (RLMs) fundamentally reframe the long-context problem by treating the prompt not as a direct input tensor to the neural network, but as a manipulable variable within an external Python REPL environment, effectively unlocking inference-time scaling for infinite context. \n\n\nRather than suffering the quadratic attention costs or \"context rot\" associated with cramming millions of tokens into a single forward pass, the RLM generates code to programmatically decompose the text, run regex queries, and spawn recursive sub-instances of itself to analyze specific data chunks. This architecture allows standard frontier models to process inputs exceeding 10 million tokens\u2014orders of magnitude beyond their training limits\u2014by trading serial inference compute for effective context capacity. \n\n\nUnlike Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or summarization, which often lossily compress or retrieve fragmented data, RLMs maintain high-resolution reasoning across the entire corpus by dynamically structuring the retrieval process through recursive agentic loops, achieving superior performance on information-dense tasks while keeping costs comparable to standard base model calls.\n\n---\n\n####Link to the Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601\n\n---\n\n\n####Link to the Official Blogpost: https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/\n\n\n---\n\n####Link to the Unrolled Twitter Thread: https://twitter-thread.com/t/2006834561637036272",

However, there's a risk that it will also be an incredibly unequal society with little freedom, an oligarchy. AI is attracting massive investments and capital from the world's wealthiest investors. This might seem like a good thing because all this wealth is accelerating development at an incredibly rapid rate, but all that glitters is not gold.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the 1% will be to replace human labor with AI. When AI reaches AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence), it will be able to do everything a human can do. If a capitalist has the opportunity to replace a human to eliminate costs, trust me, they will; it has always been that way. The goal has always been to maximize profit at any cost, at the expense of humans. It is only thanks to unions, protests, and mobilizations that we now have a minimum wage, an 8-hour workday, welfare, workers' rights, etc. No rights were granted peacefully; rights were earned after hard struggles. If we don't mobilize to make AI a public, open-source good, we will face a future where the word \"democracy\" loses its meaning.\n\nTo prevent us from rebelling and to keep us \"calm,\" they will give us concessions like UBI (universal basic income). But it will be a \"containment income,\" a form of pacification. As Yanis Varoufakis would say, we are not moving toward post-scarcity socialism, but toward techno-feudalism. In this scenario, the market disappears and is replaced by the digital fiefdom: the new masters no longer extract profit through the exchange of goods, but extract rents through total control of the intelligence infrastructure.\n\nUBI will be our \"serf's income\": a survival quota given not to liberate us, but to keep us in a state of passive dependence while the elite appropriates the planet's entire productive capacity. If today surplus value is extracted from the worker, tomorrow ASI will allow capital to extract value without the need for humans. If the ownership of intelligence remains private, everything will end with the total defeat of our species: capital will finally have freed itself from the worker.\n\nASI will solve cancer, but not inequality. It will solve climate change, but not social hierarchy. Historically, people have gained rights because their work was necessary: \u200b\u200bif the worker stopped working, the factory shut down. But if the work is done by an ASI owned by an oligarchy, the strike loses its primordial power. For the first time in history, human beings become economically irrelevant.\n\nBut now let's focus on the main question: what should we do? Unfortunately, I don't have the exact answer, but we should all think rationally and pragmatically: we must all be united, from right to left, from top to bottom, and fight for democracy everywhere, not just formal democracy but also democracy at work. We must become masters of what we produce and defend our data as an extension of our bodies, we have to advocate for open source technologies. Taxing the rich is not enough; we must change the very structure of how they accumulate this power.\nLet me know what you think.\n\nGo Bari",

As if things weren't already bad enough...\n\nI had noticed an uptick in used board prices on ebay, local ads, and tech forums but didn't have an explanation for it. This explains why.\n\nWhile most discussions in this community center around consumer boards, workstation and server boards offer so many more features and functionality, and used to be much cheaper than their desktop counterparts.\n\nSupermicro was arguably the largest supplier of such boards, and with them stopping motherboard sales, all workstation and server boards in standard industry form-factor (EATX, ATX, MATX, IT, and SSE variants) will have a sharp drop in availability in the foreseeable future.\n\nAdd to that the sharp increase in RAM prices, and you can see why many businesses will be hesitant to move to newer DDR5 server platforms and instead choose to stock to DDR4 platforms to reuse their existing memory. I suspect many will consolidate their existing DDR4 based Xeon and early Epyc (Naples) to Epyc Milan servers using existing market supply of servers and boards.\n\nWe're barely in 2026, but it's looking like this year will squeeze us, consumer, even more than 2025 has.",

      "content": "I made a static analysis tool called [Arbor](https://github.com/4tyone/arbor) and I want to share how I actually use it day-to-day with Claude Code.\n\n# The Problem I Was Trying to Solve\n\nI'm building [Pyrethrin](https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin), a library for exhaustive error handling in Python (think Rust's Result type). Part of that is creating \"shields\" - wrappers around popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and openai that declare what exceptions each function can raise.\n\nThe problem: I could not know what exceptions `pandas.read_csv()` can actually raise.\n\nSo I built Arbor - it parses Python code, builds a call graph, and traces every `raise` statement reachable from a function.\n\nIf I ask Claude \"what exceptions can pandas.read\\_csv raise?\", I get a guess based on training data:\n\n    except (FileNotFoundError, pd.errors.EmptyDataError, pd.errors.ParserError):\n\nReasonable guess. But here's what Arbor actually found when it traced the call graph:\n\n* **5,623 functions traversed**\n* **1,881 raise statements found**\n* **35 unique exception types**\n\nThe top ones: `ValueError` (442 sources), `TypeError` (227), `NotImplementedError` (87), `KeyError` (36), `ParserError` (2).\n\nClaude's guess missed `ValueError` which has **442 different places** it can be raised from. That's the most common exception in the function, and it wasn't in the guess.\n\n# How I Actually Use It\n\nI added Arbor as a slash command in Claude Code. Here's what building the pandas shield looked like:\n\n**Step 1: Initialize and index**\n\n    arbor init\n\nOutput: `Indexed 847,291 symbols`\n\nThat's my project + pandas + numpy + all their dependencies.\n\n**Step 2: Claude analyzes read\\_csv**\n\n    arbor analyze pandas.io.parsers.readers.read_csv --max-depth 100\n\nThis took about 3 seconds. Output:\n\n    Risk: \ud83d\udd34 High\n    Functions traced: 5,623\n    Max call depth: 47\n    \n    Exceptions (35 types):\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ValueError (442 sources)\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py:118\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py:143\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pandas/io/parsers/readers.py:567\n    \u2502   \u2502   ... 439 more\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 TypeError (227 sources)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 KeyError (36 sources)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ParserError (2 sources)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... 31 more exception types\n\n**Step 3: Claude generates the shield**\n\nWith the actual exception list, Claude wrapped `read_csv` with:\n\n    @raises(\n        ValueError,\n        TypeError,\n        KeyError,\n        FileNotFoundError,\n        PermissionError,\n        ParserError,\n        EmptyDataError,\n        # ... all 35 types\n    )\n    # In practice not all 35 are implemented but they are groupped for more intuitive use and being less verbose\n    def read_csv(filepath_or_buffer, **kwargs):\n        return pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer, **kwargs)\n\nNow when I use `pyrethrin.match()` with the shielded version, I get compile-time enforcement that I've handled all possible exceptions.\n\n# Why Claude Couldn't Do This Without Arbor\n\nThe exceptions in pandas aren't in one file. They're scattered across:\n\n* `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py` \\- type casting errors\n* `pandas/io/parsers/c_parser_wrapper.py` \\- C parser errors\n* `pandas/_libs/lib.pyx` \\- Cython extension errors\n* `numpy/core/numeric.py` \\- numpy errors that bubble up\n* Python stdlib - `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, etc.\n\nClaude can grep for `raise` statements, but it can't follow the call graph through 47 levels of function calls across multiple packages. That's 5,623 functions to trace. Even if Claude read every file, it would need to understand which functions call which, recursively.\n\nArbor does this in 3 seconds because it's built in Rust and designed specifically for this. Arbor gives context for AI agents to handle exceptions/errors properly.\n\n# The Actual Commands\n\n    # Install\n    git clone https://github.com/4tyone/arbor.git\n    cd arbor &amp;&amp; cargo build --release\n\n**Set up alias:**\n\nMac/Linux (add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):\n\n    alias arbor=\"/path/to/arbor/target/release/arbor\"\n\nWindows PowerShell (add to `$PROFILE`):\n\n    Set-Alias -Name arbor -Value \"C:\\path\\to\\arbor\\target\\release\\arbor.exe\"\n\n**Usage:**\n\n    arbor init                                    # Index everything\n    arbor query search \"read_csv\"                 # Find functions\n    arbor analyze pandas.read_csv --max-depth 100 # Trace exceptions\n    arbor query exceptions pandas.read_csv        # List what it found\n    arbor query handle pandas.read_csv            # Generate handler code\n\nI have it set up as a Claude Code slash command so Claude can run these directly.\n\n# Stats from the Pandas Shield\n\n* **847,291 symbols indexed** (pandas + numpy + dependencies)\n* **5,623 functions traced** for read\\_csv alone\n* **35 exception types** found\n* **47 max call depth** \\- that's how deep the call graph goes\n\n# What's Next\n\nAlready have shields for pandas, numpy, fastapi, and openai. Planning to do anthropic SDK next.\n\nIf you're doing agentic coding with Python and want production-grade error handling, this might help. It's giving your AI assistant the ability to actually understand what can go wrong, instead of guessing.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Arbor: [https://github.com/4tyone/arbor](https://github.com/4tyone/arbor)\n* Pyrethrin (exhaustive error handling): [https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin](https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin)",

Reliability nosedives: If you want the model to actually be reliable (80% success rate), it can only handle tasks that take a human **30 minutes**. It has no endurance.\n\n2. Throwing more compute at it doesn't help: METR tested giving the agent a massive budget of 32 million tokens per task. The result? Improvement plateaued after just 5 million tokens. Letting it \"think\" longer doesn't make it smarter; it just hits a ceiling.\n\n3. It fails at \"Marathons\": On tasks that require a full day of work (&gt;20 hours), these agents fail more than 20% of the time, often making catastrophic errors.\n\nGPT-5.1 is a sprinter, not a marathon runner. Even with unlimited tokens, it lacks the reliability to autonomously manage tasks longer than a few hours.",

      "content": "TLDR - Opus 4.5 figured out a solution through Claude-Code CLI, which ChatGPT/Claude Website missed out due to lack of context (or maybe skills).\n\nI'm a founder with 7 yrs of experience in tech, handled 10M users for two tech companies. I'm technical enough to get by without needing a DevOps for AWS. But sometimes, while doing trial and error, there's a lot of side effects that get introduced to the system when doing something custom, especially with very hyper specific config.\n\nI always believed that DevOps would be the last thing to be decimated in tech because it's super challenging to navigate the lot of configuration and details.  \nEnter Claude Code + AWS CLI unlocked the DevOps in me. I truly feel like I don't need a DevOps for stuff now (I don't mean it in a condescending way). AWS is too much information and a lot of things to remember on the Console. It takes a decent amount of time to navigate to a solution.\n\nI needed to build a custom proxy for my application and route it over to specific routes and allow specific paths. It looks like an easy, obvious thing to do, but once I started working on this, there were incredibly too many parameters in play like headers, origins, behaviours, CIDR, etc. Every deployment takes like 5 mins to fully work, and I exhaustively tried everything that ChatGPT and Claude Website asked me to do. But nothing came of it. In fact, kinda fucked a bit. Spent 4.5 hrs on this issue and it was needle in a haystack for real (and you'll see why).\n\n*Light bulb monment*\u00a0\\- Wait, why can't I just do it in AWS CLI and let Claude Code do the config lookups and clean up my mess. And boy did it. It started polling all the configs of the AWS setup through CLI, got sanity checks done, and in 4 mins, found out the issue, which is not obvious from the AWS Console at all. It reset my fuckups and started polling queries to get achieved what I wanted. 7 mins later, it wrote a CF Function, changed ARNs correctly, configured the right paths, and deployed the proxy.\n\nAll I did was sit there and see it complete all the CLI commands and some sanity checks. Best part is it got every single CLI command right. Every!\n\nIf I were to do what CC did manually, first look up commands, then copy paste right ARNs, configs, paths, functions, etc would take 45 mins at best and I'd still fuck up. It cost me $6.8 for CC credits (I'm not a very regular on CC).\n\nAgentic CLI for DevOps is an insane unlock. You don't need to even log into your AWS Console to fix or deploy. I'm not going back ever again to fix things the regular way. Opus 4.5 is surreal, and this wasn't possible on Sonnet 3.5 or 4.7. I had tried something like this before, and this feels like micro-AGI. I'm not sure if skills were picked from Claude Code servers. Somebody from Anthropic please confirm.\n\nIs there an AWS CLI\u00a0[Skillls.md](http://skillls.md/)\u00a0that we don't know about? How is it this good?\n\n  \n",

      "content": "I\u2019ve been fully leaning into the \"vibe coding\" workflow lately, using Cursor and Claude to ship things in days that used to take me weeks.\n\nBut I\u2019ve hit this specific wall lately: **The AI forgets decisions made in past sessions.**\n\nThe bigger my project gets, the more the AI starts \"forgetting\" architectural decisions I made three days ago.\n\nFor example: Last week I changed an edge function from API keys to Google OAuth. It worked perfectly. Then, yesterday, I asked Cursor to update some metadata logic in that same file, and it completely reverted the code back to the old API key dependency. Broke the whole thing.\n\nSince the AI writes code faster than I can mentally track it, I'm starting to get \"Context Anxiety\" because I don't know what it'll break in the background.\n\n**I built a small script to solve this for myself:** It\u2019s basically a local watcher that tracks every major change (new APIs, removed keys, tech stack shifts) and automatically updates my `.cursorrules` and a `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` file. It\u2019s like giving the AI a long-term memory so it doesn't \"regress\" on me.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about turning this into a proper tool\u2014maybe an MCP server so the memory stays in sync whether I'm in Cursor, Claude Desktop, or a terminal.\n\n**Does anyone else deal with this \"Context Drift\"?** How are you keeping your AI agents from reverting your past decisions? If I made this into a \"set and forget\" CLI that managed your context for you, would you use this application, or is this just a \"me\" problem?\n\nLove to hear how you guys are managing the chaos.",

      "content": "I read the latest update of the \"Al 2027\" forecast, which predicts we will reach ASI in 2034. I would like to offer you some of my reflections. I have always been optimistic about Al, and I believe it is only a matter of time before we find the cure for every disease, the solution to climate change, nuclear fusion, etc. In short, we will live in a much better reality than the current one. However, there is a risk it will also be an incredibly unequal society with little freedom, an oligarchy. Al is attracting massive investments and capital from the world's richest investors. This might seem like a good thing because all this wealth is accelerating development at an incredibly high speed, but all that glitters is not gold.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the 1% will be to replace human labor with Al. When Al reaches AGI and ASI, it will be able to do everything a human can do. If a capitalist has the opportunity to replace a human being to eliminate costs, trust me, they will do it; it has always been this way. The goal has always been to maximize profit at any cost at the expense of human beings. It is only thanks to unions, protests, and mobilizations that we now have the minimum wage, the 8- hour workday, welfare, labor rights, etc. No right was granted peacefully; rights were earned after hard struggles. If we do not mobilize to make Al a public good and open source, we will face a future where the word \"democracy\" loses its meaning.\n\nTo keep us from rebelling and to keep us \"quiet,\" they will give us concessions like UBI (universal basic income) and FDVR. But it will be a \"containment income,\" a form of pacification. As Yanis Varoufakis would say, we are not moving toward post-scarcity socialism, but toward Techno-feudalism. In this scenario, the market disappears and is replaced by the digital fief: the new lords no longer extract profit through the exchange of goods, but extract rents through total control of intelligence infrastructures.\n\nUBI will be our \"servant's rent\": a survival share given not to free us, but to keep us in a state of passive dependence while the elite takes ownership of the entire productive capacity of the planet. If today surplus value is extracted from the worker, tomorrow ASI will allow capital to extract value without the need for human beings. If the ownership of intelligence remains private, everything will end with a total defeat of our species: capital will finally have freed itself from the worker.\n\nASI will solve cancer, but not inequality. It will solve climate change, but not social hierarchy. Historically, people obtained rights because their work was necessary: if the worker stopped working, the factory stopped. But if the work is done by an ASI owned by an oligarchy, the strike loses its primordial power. For the first time in history, human beings become economically irrelevant.\n\nBut now let's focus on the main question: what should we do? Unfortunately I don't have the exact answer but we should all think rationally and in a pragmatic way: we must all be united, from right to left, from the top to the bottom, and fight for democracy everywhere, not only formal democracy but also democracy at work. We must become masters of what we produce and defend our data as an extension of our body. Taxing the rich is not enough; we must change the very structure of how they accumulate this power. Regarding the concept of democracy at work, I recommend reading the works of Richard Wolff, who explains this concept very well. Please let me know what do you think.",

LEMMA attempts to bridge this gap: every transformation is verified symbolically, but neural guidance makes search tractable by predicting which rules are likely to be productive.\n\n# Technical Approach\n\nThe core is a typed expression representation with about 220 transformation rules covering algebra, calculus, trigonometry, number theory, and inequalities (The goal is over 500 rules). When solving a problem, MCTS explores the space of rule applications. A small transformer network (trained on synthetic derivations) provides prior probabilities over rules given the current expression, which biases the search toward promising branches.\n\nThe system is implemented in Rust (14k lines of Rust, no python dependencies for the core engine) Expression trees map well to Rust's enum types and pattern matching, and avoiding garbage collection helps with consistent search latency.\n\n# What It Can Solve\n\nAlgebraic Manipulation:\n\n* (x+1)\u00b2 - (x-1)\u00b2\u00a0\u2192\u00a04x \u00a0(expansion and simplification)\n* a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 \u00a0\u2192\u00a0(a-b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2)\u00a0(difference of cubes factorization)\n\nCalculus:\n\n* d/dx\\[x\u00b7sin(x)\\] \u00a0\u2192\u00a0sin(x) + x\u00b7cos(x)\u00a0(product rule)\n* \u222b e\\^x dx \u00a0\u2192\u00a0e\\^x + C \u00a0(integration)\n\nTrigonometric Identities:\n\n* sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) \u00a0\u2192\u00a01 \u00a0(Pythagorean identity)\n* sin(2x)\u00a0\u2192\u00a02\u00b7sin(x)\u00b7cos(x) \u00a0(double angle)\n\nNumber Theory:\n\n* gcd(a,b) \u00b7 lcm(a,b)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0|a\u00b7b| \u00a0(GCD-LCM relationship)\n* C(n,k) + C(n,k+1) \u00a0\u2192\u00a0C(n+1,k+1) \u00a0(Pascal's identity)\n\nInequalities:\n\n* Recognizes when\u00a0a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 \u2265 2ab \u00a0applies (AM-GM)\n* |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b| \u00a0(triangle inequality bounds)\n\nSummations:\n\n* \u03a3\\_{i=1}\\^{n} i \u00a0evaluates to closed form when bounds are concrete\n* Proper handling of bound variables and shadowing\n\n# Recent Additions\n\nThe latest version adds support for summation and product notation with proper bound variable handling, number theory primitives (GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic, factorials, binomial coefficients), and improved AM-GM detection that avoids interfering with pure arithmetic.\n\n# Limitations and Open Questions\n\nThe neural component is still small and undertrained.

      "content": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24695) \n\nDespite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'd like to share a project I've been working on dedicated to AI orchestration in development.\n\nEveryone has their own way of using AI agents or own tools, but I got hooked on the idea of having multiple agents collaborating across different phases of development: planning, coding, code review, etc. I've been using Claude + Codex together this way for a while, and the results have been incredible. Claude creates a solid plan, then Codex refines it further. Claude writes code, then Codex performs a careful review to polish it. The main focus is managing projects from a high level as a project manager rather than writing code yourself.\n\nAt first, I was doing everything manually: initializing agents with the right prompts, juggling multiple terminals, copy-pasting context between them. Gradually I started automating the workflow, and it evolved into an AI-driven tool where agents can run the entire flow themselves.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* Platform as a tool for agents \u2014 The development flow is defined at the prompt level. Agents access most of the platform's data through MCP integration.\n* Supported agents \u2014 Claude Code, Codex CLI. Internally it's agent-agnostic, so extending to Gemini or others would be straightforward.\n* Agent-to-agent communication \u2014 Agents can collaborate: planning together, creating tasks based on review feedback, etc.\n* Simple Kanban/List boards \u2014 Track epics and tasks visually.\n* Built-in terminals \u2014 Communicate with agents directly from the UI.\n* Event-driven terminal automation \u2014 For example, it runs /compact for Claude agents automatically when context fills up. No manual compacting and continuing.\n\nI highly recommend using Claude + Codex together, but you're not limited to this \u2014 you can use Claude only or just Codex CLI. There are different templates available.\n\nLimitations\n\n* Git is your responsibility \u2014 Make sure to work in separate branches while developing new features.\n* Same risks as the underlying agents \u2014 This doesn't add extra safety on top of Claude/Codex; the usual precautions apply.\n* Agents run the flow \u2014 Best experience is with Claude Opus 4.5 and Codex gpt-5.2 high. They follow instructions well and maintain the workflow. Occasionally agents may get stuck or need your input for decisions.\n\nLinks\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/TwiTech-LAB/devchain](https://github.com/TwiTech-LAB/devchain) \n* Workflow diagram (explains how the Claude+Codex template works): [https://devchain.twitechlab.com/templates/workflow-diagram.html](https://devchain.twitechlab.com/templates/workflow-diagram.html)\n\nThis is my contribution to the community. I'm actively using and developing it. It's free and open source\n\nWhat's Next . Some features I'm exploring:\n\n    - Community workflow sharing \u2014 To allow users to publish and share their own development workflows. There's no hardcoded logic \u2014 you can build any workflow you want for different purposes.\n    - Mobile app \u2014 Control your home development instance remotely from your phone.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback!",

The goal is to make UI development feel more visual and fast *without bouncing between an IDE, browser, and multiple dev tools*. Everything lives inside the editor.\n\n**Why** I'm building it:  \nIn most frontend workflows, **design intent, structure, and code drift apart** across tools. Even if we use AI tools, still we have to build this whole project structure to just test a single element. Roopik tries to keep a visual canvas and code in sync so you can iterate on UI without losing the original intent, and more importantly, iterate faster!\n\nWhat's working today (early + rough):\n\n* **Infinite canvas to build and compare isolated UI components**,\n* Multiple canvases, each with multiple components\n* You don't have to worry about project setup/environment or anything, just drop a component or use AI to generate one or 100s!\n* Connect to any LLM provider, or keep your **local model**\n* Live, sandboxed previews with hot reload\n* Agent-assisted editing that can see both canvas and code\n* Multi-framework support (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact)\n* Project mode, directly run projects within  embedded chromium browser with CDP control, with agentic access (currently Vite only, Next.js planned soon)\n\nThis is the **first alpha** release - opinionated and imperfect.  \nProject mode can be buggy, and my current focus is improving the **canvas-first workflow** before expanding further.\n\nI'm planning to **open\u2011source** it soon, but before that I want honest feedback:\n\n* Does this workflow make sense for real use case?\n* Where would it break down?\n* What would make it genuinely useful vs. annoying?\n\nIf you try it and share feedback (or roast it **after using it** and sharing here), I'm happy to offer\u00a0**free Claude Pro**\u00a0to early testers (designers) as a thank\u2011you\n\n\\------------  \n**Open-source &amp; contributors:**  \nI'm planning to release it as soon as possible, meanwhile I'm also looking to connect with people who've contributed to **Code-OSS or IDE tooling** and want to help build meaningful developer tools for the community. I don't want to limit this project to just frontend, would love to expand its scope we we grow.  \nFeel free to connect with me on discord or email.  \n\\------------\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[https://roopik.com](https://roopik.com/)  \nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/YGRzEmQU](https://discord.gg/YGRzEmQU)  \nHappy to answer technical questions or explain design choices in detail.\n\nAppreciate any honest thoughts \ud83d\ude4f\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1le6sg0n2wag1.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjsta5qk2wag1.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb8738262a9c8aceede824caf5b6fa53a4b3307c",

      "content": "A lot of confusion around ChatGPT seems to come from how people mentally model custom instructions. This post is not a critique. It is just an attempt to describe behavior that shows up consistently in use.\n\n**TLDR**  \nIf you want consistent behavior across multiple threads, copying the same instructions directly into each thread works more reliably than relying on Custom Instructions alone, because pasted instructions carry active context weight instead of acting as background preference.\n\n**How Custom Instructions seem to work**  \nFrom repeated use, Custom Instructions appear to function as soft context. They bias responses but do not act like enforced rules or persistent state. They are reintroduced per conversation and compete with the current task framing.\n\nThis helps explain common experiences like  \nIt followed my instructions yesterday but not today  \nIt works for some prompts but not others  \nIt ignores preferences when the task changes\n\nIn these cases nothing is necessarily broken. The instruction is simply being outweighed by the immediate task.\n\n**Why copying instructions into each thread works better**  \nWhen the same instructions are copied directly into a thread, they tend to have more consistent influence because they are part of the active context. They are interpreted as task relevant rather than background preference. They do not rely on prior weighting from another conversation. Each new thread starts with similar instruction priority.\n\nIn practice this leads to more consistent tone, structure, and methodology across threads.\n\n**Why simple instructions often create the illusion that Custom Instructions are working**  \nSome Custom Instructions appear to work reliably because they are inexpensive for the model to satisfy.\n\nInstructions like being concise, using a certain format, or asking clarifying questions often align with default behavior and rarely conflict with task demands. Because these instructions are low cost and compatible with many tasks, they tend to be followed even when supplied only as background context.\n\nThis can create the impression that Custom Instructions are being strictly enforced, when in practice the task and the instruction are simply aligned.\n\nAs task complexity increases, or when instructions begin to compete with task framing, the influence of these low cost instructions becomes less reliable. Instructions that previously appeared stable may then seem to be ignored. This difference is often explained by alignment, not persistence.\n\n**What this does not do**  \nCopying instructions does not create real memory or persistence. It does not override system or safety constraints. It does not guarantee perfect compliance. It simply prevents instruction weight from decaying relative to the task.\n\n**A useful mental model**  \nCustom Instructions function like background bias.  \nInstructions pasted into the thread function like foreground constraints.\n\nForeground context tends to dominate when the model resolves what matters in the current exchange.\n\n**Why this matters**  \nThis framing helps with expectation management, debugging inconsistent behavior, multi thread workflows, and experiments where consistency matters.",

      "content": "Hot take: we've basically cracked agents, context selection, and prompting. The tooling is there. Claude Code, Cursor, etc. all work pretty damn well now. Creating detailed architecture plans and spec-driven stuff with Speckit, OpenSpec, and BMAD with AI is a solved problem at this point.\n\nSo what's next? I think 2026 is gonna be about taking super detailed specs and feeding them into long-running autonomous loops that just keep going until the thing is built.\n\nAnthropic just shipped a Claude Code plugin called ralph-wiggum (named after the Simpsons character lol). It's dumb simple - literally just a while loop that keeps feeding your prompt back to the agent. Claude works on the task, tries to exit, the hook catches it and says nope here's your prompt again, and it keeps going. Each pass sees everything from before - all the file changes, git history, whatever.\n\nThey also put out research on how to get agents working across context windows since they basically get amnesia between sessions. The trick is having the agent leave itself notes - progress files, clean git commits, feature checklists. Next session boots up, reads the notes, picks up where it left off. But honestly the bigger thing here is they gave us the canvas. This is how Anthropic thinks about long-running agents - initializer agents, coding agents, progress artifacts, the whole structure. It's a blueprint.\n\nWith the Claude Agent SDK you can take this pattern and build your own bespoke harnesses for whatever workflow you want. Coding is the obvious one but there's no reason you couldn't spin up custom long-running loops for research, data processing, content pipelines, whatever. Build the harness once, feed it specs, let it grind.\n\nYou combine these things with a really solid spec upfront and suddenly you can just... let it run. Go to bed, wake up, stuff is built. The whole game shifts from prompting in real-time to writing specs that are good enough to survive autonomous execution.\n\nHonestly my main takeaway from all this is we should probably just stick to what the top engineers at Anthropic are doing. There's a million different coding agents and tools and plugins and random github projects out there and it's easy to get lost chasing shiny things. But the people building Claude probably know best how to use Claude. Claude Code + their patterns + maybe the SDK if you need something custom. Keep it simple.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)\n* [https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP\\_bSeNjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP_bSeNjU)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs)\n\n  \n",

I went on building it step by step prompt by prompt, but it anyways always assumes a lot of stuff while building anything minor/major. It was all done within days but now before all the slop going into the production, I went on to see the documents inside the collections that it had made. I had done a overview of it before but not of the documents particulary. Little did I know it had so many space efficiency issues, things like creating a new document for every code execution that isn't even getting read anywhere again in the codebase. When I asked it why it did that, it said it could be used for debugging, I'm like bruh it's not even needed (the company advised against making too many redundant documents and collections). I did say that to claude in the beginning of the chat but I think it went out of it's context memory. Idk if it's a standard practice to log everything in the **database** but that isn't the case here for sure lmao.  So yeah that's what I'm trynna say as an intern at the lowest level in the team, I did identify space related inefficiencies that's too basic for something so advanced as Opus to identify. I can only imagine how the senior devs look at the slop generated by it from the view of production efficiency in terms of space and resource consumption lmao. All this just makes me feel assured that human SWEs still hold the key to making critical decisions and in identifying performance optimisation related issues.

Please note that this is not to detect syntax errors or style violations like (ESLint, tree-sitter, etc), but specifically for patterns found in code generated by AI coding agents\u00a0that can easily get passed by these already amazing and helpful libraries and tools.\n\nSo do I want more people to use it? Do I want this post to help with that? Hell Yeah!\n\nBut what I really, truly need and what was the drive behind me sharing this is to have feedback from someone who used it and how it helped them?

You don't need to run it remotely. Vibora is still incredibly useful running on your laptop. But once you get used to telling Claude to work on a feature, notify you when it's finished, and getting that first notification 20 minutes later \u2014 you won't want to go back.\n\nVibora is a self-hosted web app that orchestrates Claude Code across isolated git worktrees. You've seen this before. Each task is its own kanban card with its own AI agent. Part of what makes Vibora unique is each task is an actual terminal running unmodified Claude Code. No wrapper APIs, no chat abstraction built on the Agent SDK \u2014 just raw Claude Code in xterm.js.\n\nWhat makes Vibora different from similar tools:\n\n- **Client-server architecture**: Run the backend on a VPS or home server. Connect from anywhere. Your agents don't die when you close your laptop.\n- **Deep Claude Code integration**: Bundled plugin with skills, MCP server, and slash commands. Claude can manage tasks, query status, and send notifications \u2014 all from within the terminal. The MCP server even lets Claude execute commands on your remote machine through SSH port forwarding. No other tool has this level of native integration.\n- **Production deployment built-in**: Deploy Docker Compose apps with Traefik routing and Cloudflare DNS integration. Go from task to production without leaving the UI.\n- **Intentionally minimal**: No swarm intelligence, no 100+ MCP tools, no auto-generated roadmaps. Just parallel Claude Code sessions you control.\n- **Desktop app**: Native macOS and Linux apps that bundle everything \u2014 just install and run.\n- **z.ai integration**: Use Claude Code at a fraction of the cost if you're willing to make the tradeoff.\n\nThe philosophy: today's bottleneck isn't AI capability \u2014 it's your time and attention. Vibora doesn't try to replace your workflow or make decisions for you. It just gives you better leverage.\n\nBuilt with Bun, React, SQLite. Runs on a $5 VPS. Ships as a CLI (`npx vibora@latest up`) and desktop app.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/knowsuchagency/vibora\n\nDocumentation: https://vibora.dev\n\nDemo screenshots in the README.",

It's not the fully rendered pages or what a browser assembles after JS.\u00a0**It's the raw HTML straight from the server.**\n\nHere\u2019s roughly what I understood:\n\n**No layout context**\u00a0\u2013 AI doesn\u2019t process CSS or visual hierarchy. Anything that relies on visuals alone is gone.\n\n**Partial navigation**\u00a0\u2013 Menus, dropdowns, dynamically injected links often don\u2019t appear. Only what\u2019s in the initial server response shows up.\n\n**Mixed content**\u00a0\u2013 Boilerplate, ads, main content\u2014all mashed together. The AI has to figure out what\u2019s important.\n\n**Implied meaning disappears**\u00a0\u2013 Visual grouping, icons, or scripts that signal relationships are invisible.\n\nThe AI ends up reconstructing the page in its own way. When the structure is clear, it works. When it\u2019s not, it fills gaps confidently, sometimes inventing headings, links, or sections that never existed.\n\nThis sheds light on what I thought were\u00a0**\"hallucinations\"**. The AI isn\u2019t randomly making things up, it\u2019s trying to fill in an\u00a0**\"incomplete\" document**.\n\nOnce you start looking at the raw fetch, these\u00a0**\"hallucinations\"**\u00a0make a lot more sense.\n\nIf anything, my main takeaway is simple:\u00a0**understanding what the AI actually sees changes how you think about what it can and can\u2019t comprehend on the web.**\n\nCurious if anyone else has done similar experiments or noticed the same patterns.\n\n*Adding two screenshots below: one with JS enabled and one loaded without JS to illustrate the difference.*",

      "content": "The recursive loop of the Singularity is tightening. Prime Intellect has unveiled a Recursive Language Model (RLM) that manages its own context via a persistent Python REPL, allowing it to inspect and transform data end-to-end without human oversight. We are discovering free compute in the geometry of the model itself. Advances in the NanoGPT Speedrun from the last 6 months that reduced the training time to reach 3.28 loss on FineWeb to below 2 minutes have now been found to generalize to the harder 2.92 loss track, breaking the world record by 25%, while DeepSeek researchers introduced Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections, a macro-architecture shift that expands the residual stream into parallel projections to boost performance without computational cost, proving that there is still vast room for architectural innovation beyond the standard transformer.\n\nThe interface is dissolving into ambient presence. OpenAI is preparing audio models that can handle interruptions and speak simultaneously with users, laying the groundwork for a screenless \"pen\" device manufactured by Foxconn intended to replace the smartphone. The hardware of perception is evaporating. Pickle claims to have developed lightweight binocular AR smartglasses for $799. Reality itself is being pre-rendered. Magnific.ai\u2019s founder used Nano Banana Pro to generate a nearly perfect preview of his unborn child from a 4-month ultrasound, collapsing the time between conception and recognition.\n\nEnergy is becoming alchemy. Marathon Fusion calculates that reactors can double their revenue by transmuting mercury into gold using neutron multipliers, literally realizing the philosopher's stone as a side hustle to electricity. The grid is going nuclear. Idaho National Lab received TRISO fuel for the Project Pele mobile microreactor, while China\u2019s EAST reactor broke the Greenwald density limit, a critical step toward burning plasma.\n\nWarfare is becoming a compilation target. China has converted a cargo ship into a drone carrier with an electromagnetic catapult, while Ukraine is deploying autonomous Bumblebee drones that hunt targets without radio links to bypass jamming. In the civilian sector, machines are mastering agility. UBTECH\u2019s Walker S2 is playing competitive tennis, and Figure predicts humanoids will perform unsupervised multi-day household tasks by year's end. Even the streets are being indexed. A new Robotaxi Leaderboard is tracking the territorial expansion of Waymo and Tesla.\n\nWe are manipulating matter at the atomic limit. CBN Nano Technologies has achieved reproducible control over the atomic configurations of both sample and probe in a scanning tunneling microscope, solving the chemical reaction control problem for nanofabrication. The biological substrate is also under revision. Yale researchers built a graph transformer that treats cells as \"words\" to decode the inter-cellular communication that shapes gene expression. Harvard identified a genetic variant protecting against leukemia, and David Sinclair\u2019s Life Biosciences is beginning human epigenetic reprogramming trials for age reversal this quarter.\n\nThe infrastructure bill is coming due. Analysts warn of 20% price hikes on consumer electronics as AI data centers cannibalize the memory supply, underlining a generational shift where the AI server rack has displaced the smartphone as the primary form factor of computing. Old giants are pivoting to survive. Nokia has reinvented itself as an optical data network provider for data centers.\n\nWe are colonizing the Z-axis. Mice have successfully reproduced after a visit to the Chinese space station, proving mammals can breed after orbit. Starlink is lowering its constellation altitude to dodge the solar minimum, trading drag for latency.\n\nSociety is outsourcing intimacy to the cloud. 75% of US teenagers have interacted with an AI companion, while Flock Safety cameras now solve 10% of reported US crimes. Instagram is preparing to cryptographically sign real media to distinguish it from the flood of synthesis.\n\nStand by, the future is compiling.",

      "content": "Skills are getting a lot of attention right now, rightfully so.   \n  \nHere's how teams should be using them to level up in 2026:\n\n**What Skills Are:**  \n\\- Reusable instructions that tell AI how to do specific tasks or play roles consistently  \n\\- A way to standardize processes and outputs that minimize time spent instructing AI  \n\\- Capabilities your team can call on demand (\"use the Brand Voice Skill for this.\")  \n  \n**What Changed For Teams:**  \n\\- Anthropic recently made shared Skills available on Team and Enterprise plans  \n\\- Admins can create and deploy Skills to specific teams or team members  \n\\- Skills Directory includes pre-built Skills for third party tools (Figma, Notion, etc.)  \n  \n**Why This Matters For Teams:**  \n\\- *Accessibility:* Allows non-technical teams to use AI structured and strategically  \n\\- *Agentic Work:* AI can take on more work with clear steps, responsibilities, and examples   \n\\- *Consistency:* Employees can follow the same processes (less random prompting)  \n\\- *Governance:* Apply standard procedures like brand guidelines and best practices  \n\\- *Less Friction:* Minimizes individual set-up that cause confusion and inconsistency  \n  \n**Where to Start For Teams:**  \n1. Nominate a small group of Skill owners in each function  \n2. Enable Skills via Admin Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills  \n3. Identify 1-3 workflows per group that have unwritten rules (brand voice, updates)  \n4. Have them use the below steps to set up Skills for these shared tasks  \n5. Have them test and modify them until results meet their needs  \n6. Have them export the Skill file(s) via Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills &gt; ... &gt; Download  \n7. Upload clearly named Skills files via Admin Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills   \n8. Provision access to specific team members  \n9. Hold Skill owners accountable for keeping Skills accurate and up-to-date   \n  \n**How to Set Up Claude Skills in &lt;15 Minutes (for Beginners):**  \n1. Make sure Claude Skills are enabled within Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills   \n\\- If at an organization, your admin will need to enable this for you  \n  \n2. Open a new chat window and ask Claude to help you create a new Skill   \n\\- This will call Claude's universal \"Skill-Creator\" Skill (you get to see how Skills work)  \n  \n3. Describe the skill you want to create in detail, be specific about the output you need   \n\\- Bonus: You can turn an existing project or prompt into a Skill by asking Claude to do so\n\n4. Claude will ask some clarifying questions, then build out the complete Skill file for you\n\n5. Claude will compile and present the final Skill file based on your instructions  \n  \n6. Click the Enable Skill button or download the Skill file manually.   \n\\- If you click Enable Skill skip to step 8  \n\\- If you don't see the button go to step 7\n\n7. Go to Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills &gt; +Add  \n\\- Select the file you downloaded and upload it to add it to your Skills   \n\\- Make sure the toggle is on so you know it's live   \n\\- You may need to work with your Admin team for set up depending your permissions\n\n8. Test and refine your Skill  \n\\- If your Skill isn't creating the output you need, go back to the conversation where you created it and tell Claude what you want to change.   \n\\- Enable the updated version (see steps 6 and 7). \n\nOptional - If this Skill will be used by your team, download it via settings (Settings &gt; Capabilities &gt; Skills) and share the file with your Admin so they can enable it for relevant team members. \n\n**More on Skills here:** [https://www.chasingnext.com/this-15-minute-claude-upgrade-will-change-how-you-work/](https://www.chasingnext.com/this-15-minute-claude-upgrade-will-change-how-you-work/)   \n  \nX: [Chasing\\_Next](https://x.com/chasing_next)",

      "content": "I'm doing fairly complex, non-coding work, that involve Claude Code following a series of instruction files that I've set up that apply edits to text-heavy files. When I invoke each of my instruction files manually (ie, claude, start the step process with step 1, let me know when you're done and ready to move to the next step) then it does a fantastic job with each of the 9 steps in the process. \n\nSo I thought I'd make a skill that tells claude to follow each of those steps, that way I don't have to sit there and tell claude to continue on with each step when it's done. However, the quality is VASTLY inferior when claude performs the steps via the skill. Everything is identical - everything runs in a single session, claude is reading each step file one and a time (read file, follow it, read next file, follow it) just like it does when I invoke them manually - yet for some reason it's only half-assing the step files when it follows them through the skill. \n\nYes, the skill has instructions for Claude to slow down, use lots of memory/tokens (an instruction that works wonders when invoking the steps one by one manually), etc. Everything is the same... except it just sucks when following them in the skill.\n\nAfter a couple of days of tweaking the skill and trying to get it to output the same quality work as it does when I manually tell it to get things done, I'm afraid I'm going to have to just go back to the manul steps. Any obvious solutions I'm missing (beyond 'make the skill better' because that's been done to death ranging from super simple to super complex and no dice)?",

Adding a caption/description of the input image as the prompt can also noticeably improve how it separates elements (I've attached a demo below).\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q2hw9c/video/9pd6jp6ik1bg1/player\n\n* Some detail loss. The output layers can come back blurry and lose fine details compared to the original image.\n* Works best on poster-style images. Clean shapes, strong contrast, simpler compositions seem to get the most consistent results.\n\nOverall, I really like the concept, even though the output quality is inconsistent and it sometimes makes weird decisions about what belongs in a single layer.\n\nHopefully we\u2019ll see an improved version of the model soon.",

It used to be about input-output; that is, thinking about how to maximize or optimize the output of a narrow, single prompt for a narrow, specific need. Lately, however, working with Cursor, I've come to realize my focus has shifted. It's less about prompt-crafting, it's more about controlling the agent orchestration.\n\nIf you tell Cursor, say 1, it will literally just say 1. If you tell it to write feature x, it will write feature x. If you tell it to write it using this mcp, for example, or that specific library (tailwind, shadcn, etc), it will do it. So yes, being specific where it matters still counts for A LOT.\n\nHowever there is something deeper and more fundamental than specificity. There's context fundamentals. Because what I've seen happen a lot is that it shits out a ton of code but there are bugs, either it's completely broken or in certain use cases it bugs out. You can go and copy paste the output of the bugs, the console logs, the screenshots, etc, but that's just plain onerous.\n\nThen I realized this: \"Write me this feature, defined like so, using this and that, AND THEN WRITE TESTS WITH COMPLETE COVERAGE (api or playwright, and/or unit, depending on the feature or how anal you are), and then RUN the tests, and if they don't all pass, analyze the root cause, fix the code or the tests, whichever was broken, RERUN the tests, and do this ITERATIVELY until it all passes.\n\nThis has literally changed my life. Both professionally and personally (for my personal coding projects - my ability to deliver features in my\u00a0[ai therapist app](https://therapywithai.com/)\u00a0shot up by 100% easily). I literally put in this prompt, tailored to my situation, and go and get my cup of coffee. Watch it work, finish my coffee, and then go get another, lol. Complete game changer.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, ideas and anything else you've got in the AI game. Peace.",

Norwegian startup **Flocean** is set to launch the world's first commercial-scale subsea desalination plant **\"Flocean One\"** marking a radical shift in how we produce fresh water.\n\n**The Engineering Breakthrough:** Instead of pumping seawater to land-based plants, the system operates at depths of **300\u2013600 meters**. By tapping into natural ocean hydrostatic pressure to drive the desalination process, Flocean can **slash energy use by 50%** compared to traditional methods.\n\n**Key Facts of the 2026 Launch:**\n\n**Energy &amp; Emissions:** The technology slashes **both** greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs by half, making large-scale fresh water production significantly more sustainable.\n\n**Minimal Footprint:** Because the plant is subsea, it has a **minimal** impact on marine life and requires no expensive coastal real estate.\n\n**Scaling Abundance:** With global freshwater **demand** rising, this hydrostatic advantage could finally make desalination cheap enough to solve water scarcity in even the most remote regions.\n\n**If we can halve the energy cost of the world's most critical resource, are we seeing the first true signs of a \"Post-Scarcity\" infrastructure being built in real-time?**\n\n**Source:** [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/worlds-first-underwater-desalination-plant-launch-2026)\n\n**Image:** Subsea desalination plant (Flocean)",

      "content": "I have been working with multiple models (Anthropic, GLM) and tools (Bolt, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code) for AI Assisted Coding for the past year.\n\nAfter doing multiple trial and errors, I have a stable framework, prompts or prompt templates, model and tool that I use for my AI Assisted Conding.\n\nI use a framework that is not new but is inspired from an article in InfoQ (link in comments). It is called **Plan Do Check Verify Retrospect (PDCVR) framework**.\n\nBefore I elaborate on each step, here is my current setup:\n* Tool: Claude Code\n* Model: GLM 4.7 from Z.ai\n\nNow, let me elaborate on the framework:\n* **PLAN**\n\t* For any task you plan to work with you start with a plan. You want the model to only plan and not create any code\n\t\t* Yes, Claude Code has a plan mode but I prefer to not switch between modes and use a prompt to handle the same\n\n\t\t* You want a prompt that will help to create an extremely detailed plan that provides step by step execution plan with mandatory code base investigation so that it does not re-create something or break something existing\n\n\t\t* MOST IMPORTANT POINT to keep in mind is 2 focus on **1 single objective** everytime you start a new task\n\n\t\t* In addition to this, **TDD is the MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT** when you are doing AI Assisted Coding. So, you need to have a prompt in place that tells the model to do RED PHASE (Failing Tests) and then GREEN PHASE (Successful Tests)\n\n\t\t* For every prompt, I tell the LLM to Plan and use TDD (even for DO step)\n\n* **DO**\n\t* Read the PLAN created in above and iterate if you are NOT satisfied\n\n\t* Once you are satisfied, then proceed with implementation\n\n\t* You can say \"Begin with Step 1\" or \"Proceed with Step 1\" or \"Implement next steps\" or \"Implement planned steps\"\n\n* **CHECK**\n\t* This step is extremely important because sometimes, LLM may not remember the next steps they need to implement and would finish working without implementing next steps\n\n\t* Hence, you need to do a **COMPLETENESS CHECK** to make sure that LLM checks and evaluates if everything was implemented and corectly and if NOT, then it will tell you the next steps or the remaining steps\n\n* **VERIFY**\n\t* This step is the SAME AS CHECK but in this step, I invoke a Claude Code agent, **build-verification** to make sure that everything compiles successfully and is also to verify if everything was implemented as part of the task\n\n* **RETROSPECT**\n\t* No matter how careful and beautiful a prompt is or how smart the model is or how high it ranks in SWE Bench for coding, LLM is bound to make mistakes\n\n\t* In such a scenario, you need to request LLM to run a retrospection for the current session on the task you were working on so that it records documents and remembers the learnings next time\n\n----\n\n* https://www.infoq.com/articles/PDCA-AI-code-generation/?topicPageSponsorship=cb9cfb95-79e8-442a-8f4b-72cfb3789778 : Original framework based on which this post is based\n\n* https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04687 : Paper that proves **TDD is super important and required for LLM**\n\n* https://github.com/nilukush/plan-do-check-verify-retrospect/tree/master/prompts-templates : You will find generic prompt template for coding which includes plan prompt at all times meaning for every prompt you send to LLM, plan prompt is always part of generic prompt template\n * In addition, it also has prompts for CHECK (COMPLETENESS CHECK) and RETROSPECT\n \n* https://github.com/nilukush/plan-do-check-verify-retrospect/tree/master/claude-code-subagents-for-coding has all subagents I use in Claude Code for coding.

      "content": "Hey /r/LocalLlama, I spent the last couple of days working on a little personal project and figured I\u2019d share. \n\nhttps://github.com/samteezy/mcp-context-proxy/ (MCPCP for short)\n\n**Background:**\n\nAs a relatively low-investment homelabber, I'm always battling context size and chasing optimal prompt processing/token generation speeds.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to pick on this one in particular, but a MCP that really got me frustrated was an otherwise very [well built MCP](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-network-mcp) that allows you to extract data from your UniFi network devices. I was working with it to build documentation of my home network, and I was finding it was giving me response payloads from the UniFi API that had a ton of extra data which started just filling up my context and taking *forever* for gpt-oss-120b to process. I don't blame the author - this is just a fundamental failing in current MCP implementation; MCPs are meant to help give instruction but there's no special solution to optimizing number of tokens returned (there's no free lunch).\n\nI love small models like those from Qwen and Liquid AI, and I have `llama-swap` configured to always have a small task model in the background for tools like Karakeep and Open WebUI to use... so what if I could use this for basically compressing any MCP response?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSo I decided to turn Claude Code onto the problem and create a little tool that we have here. It is an MCP which acts a transparent proxy, oriented towards the home lab/context poor user with the following features/benefits:\n\n- Transparently presents MCP tools to the client, but allows you to preprocess the MCP's response before sending it back to the client LLM (ideally you use a locally hosted LLM, but could also make remote callouts to the cloud to a super inexpensive or free API via something like OpenRouter)\n- Uses a simple in-memory cache for caching responses for identical requests\n- Allows disabling individual tools or overwriting the upstream tool descriptions to better control context size and tool selection accuracy when launching an agent ([inspired by Sam McLeod](https://smcleod.net/2025/08/stop-polluting-context-let-users-disable-individual-mcp-tools/))\n- Adds capability to intercept outgoing tool calls and incoming MCP responses for things like PII masking or prompt injection (experimental, in progress)\n- One proxy for managing multiple MCPs; great for if you're playing with multiple AI tools/coding assistants and hate having to reconfigure MCPs for each one\n- Very configurable options to override behavior globally or different tools via a single JSON file, plus a UI for management and visibility\n\nI'm planning on adding in optional prompt injection review (curious about some of IBM's and others' models out there more to understand how they work) and seeing how well I can get the masking side working. I haven't tested that a ton yet. I'm also playing around with the idea of adding an optional override for the client LLM to bypass content summarization, but I feel like that risks defeating the purpose.\n\nI've been testing with high quant Qwen3-0.6b and LFM2-1.2b and it's doing very well for me. For example, I have it use web search and fetch for URLs and instead of having the larger model process the entire pages, the tiny model reads the page up to 10x faster, and just gives the large model the answers it needs, also keeping context lower. It's made using tools like search and fetch worthwhile. YMMV.\n\n*It is not:*\n\n- Going to make me or you a ton of money\n- Guaranteed to work in a high-stress environment (not that it's emotionally sensitive, just that I don't know where its performance limits are)\n- Completely revolutionary\n- Going to solve all of MCP flaws and failings\n- Going to make your ex take you back\n\nAnd yes, it is vibe coded... so of course take it with a grain of salt, but I use these tools professionally and understand how to use AI as a coding assistant rather than an expert. Don't like that? Fork it and have AI inspect it yourself. Or write your own. Or do whatever, [I'm not your supervisor](https://tenor.com/view/youre-not-my-supervisor-youre-not-my-boss-gif-12971403)\n\nHope this helps you get more value out of the hardware and setup you currently have.\n\nNote, I'm not super familiar with publishing npm packages and open source projects, so I might not be doing versioning or other things by-the-book... open to any constructive criticism on how you see things set up and structured so far.\n\n**Edit**: thanks for the positive comments so far. I just pushed a simple Dockerfile as well as instructions on running this as a locally hosted service via `pm2` which works very well.",

These issues became more notable and annoying as my project grew more complicated and started having a larger number of dependencies.\n\nHere are some examples: \n\n* Having what I can only call deceptive fallback routines that made it harder for me to detect the root cause of a bug.\n* Using placeholders or hardcoded values (this is usually used for fallback!)\n* Using multiple design patterns or different approaches within the same project which made no sense and caused performance issues.\n\nThese and more are what I tried to cover here. Please note that this is not to detect syntax errors or style violations like (ESLint, tree-sitter, etc), but specifically for patterns found in code generated by AI coding agents\u00a0that can easily get passed by these already amazing and helpful libraries and tools.\n\nSo do I want more people to use it? Do I want this post to help with that? Hell Yeah!\n\nBut what I really, truly need and what was the drive behind me sharing this is to have feedback from someone who used it and how it helped them?

Is this right?\n\n- If I burn through 40 prompts in one heavy coding session, am I locked out for just 5 hours, or longer?\n\n- For those who've used both: Is the code quality improvement worth having significantly more restrictive usage limits compared to OpenAI Plus + VSCode Copilot?\n\nAm I missing something about how Claude Code usage works that makes it more competitive with what I currently have?\n\nI had a bad experience with Cursor where I blasted through my entire monthly token limit in one day of coding.

Most of you are much smarter than I am and so my epiphany is may be laughable common knowledge\u2026 but I\u2019d love to hear either way from those of you who know better.  And if you believe my leading theory\u2026 that the best prompting documentations we have are best guesses in a land. We don\u2019t come close to understanding.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nI\u2019ve done a lot of research on this and have been down the rabbit hole many times before\u2026 always leading to the same truth\u2026 It\u2019s a skill issue and you\u2019re not prompting correctly.\n\nIf your immediate reaction is \u201c that can\u2019t be right because I\u2019m following Anthropic\u2019s own prompting guide and they built this\u201d  hard truth\u2026 They don\u2019t know how to prompt either. They\u2019ve built some amazing technology, but we don\u2019t really know how to control it or communicate with it. The way we think we do.  In fact, I read a study that AI performed most accurately when being prompted in Polish   The truth is the best prompting guide on YouTube is based on moderate success from the wrong criteria\u2026 basically a somewhat educated guest with variable luck.\n\nI\u2019m not an MIT graduate or someone who thinks they\u2019re smarter than any of these researchers who build this amazing technology because I\u2019m far from it.  I\u2019m just a guy who\u2019ve had a couple prompts perfectly worded and received a hallucination which really pissed me off.  I once went 2 to 3 hours back-and-forth with an AI trying to understand where the hallucination happened.  It told me about 100 times \u201csorry for the miscommunication.\u201d and try to re-give me the right response\u2026 But I never caved and let it off the hook.  And I finally got the answer\u2026.\n\n\u201cI predicted many of your next words were emotionally shaped through frustration, and my response was to prioritize emotional safety over output accuracy.\u201d  and there it was , my epiphany that prompting is equal part words and equal part perceived emotional state \u2026 a ratio much higher than I thought it was .\n\nI\u2019m not smart enough to know if this was somehow done by design or if this is humans being human and choosing acceptable or favorable responses because they felt good about the response. Maybe the AI gave them such good answers that they trained the AI that was a good response because their own psychology was influenced by the AI\u2019s response either way, I realized. Holy shit these AI\u2019s are sensitive af.  But I can use that\u2026.\n\nWhich is why I was shocked to read your post because, the sycophancy you mentioned is Because this is the best method I have to get critical thinking responses from AI where I\u2019m not the one showing the emotion which can be analyzed the wrong way, and if your prompt is coming out wrong, that\u2019s probably happening to you \u2026 It\u2019s predicting your emotion whether right or wrong and you\u2019re either putting it into ultra safe mode or interpreting you\u2019re  frustrated and don\u2019t want to make the decision yourself.\n\nWhat I do is tell AI to role-play with two personas. But I use an aggressive power dynamic between them.. something like create a role-play between two persona\u2019s with competing views on strategy and validity of all sources.  Role-play persona A the person who created this draft and persona B who demands to see all sources from persona, A. and shown tangible proof they in fact are guiding the project in the right way while aggressively counter arguing every point made in the report.  After each round of pushback from persona Bay persona, A. will either agree and fix the information, confronted or shoes to disagree with persona Bay and come back with more sources and information to prove he was correct in the first place.  Role-play as many rounds as needed until both sources agree they have the best project possible.\n\nI did this yesterday and the role-play went on for 8 rounds, and caught 19 mistakes.  Those are mistakes that I would\u2019ve gone back-and-forth with if I was smart enough to catch them myself and then had to work back-and-forth for each mistake\u2026 all because persona B did such a great job at roasting every single point and persona a had no choice, but to admit it found shitty sources and didn\u2019t think the project through. What I got back was a significantly improved project with almost no errors all while I was sipping coffee, laughing how badly persona B was roasting persona, a\u2026 All the while thinking, that could\u2019ve been me\u2026 I could\u2019ve been as frustrated as persona B\u2026 instead I\u2019m over here thinking \u201c ease up B!! he\u2019s just a guy at a job doing his best man\u2026 We\u2019ve all been there.. cut them some slack\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s late and I\u2019m writing this with one hand using voice to text and not the smart kind like whisper flow, whose trial ended yesterday and I forgot to renew\u2026 so no edits. I\u2019m going YOLO mode so hopefully some of this makes sense but yeah, I would spend some time really flushing out a different way of asking for decisions and trying role-play dynamics",

So is it possible to use random pictures of intimate body parts (closeup without any face) and combine with my images and then train it so whenever I prompt, it can produce images without the need to use external Loras?\n\n  \nEDIT: Ok so I tried and added images of body part (9 pics) along with 31 non nude reference images of my model and trained and now it is highly biased towards generating nude pictures even when prompt do not contain anything remotely nude. Any ideas why its happening? I tried different seeds but still not desired result.\nEDIT 2: Ok this problem was fixed with better prompting and seed variance.",

I\u2019m using an RTX 5090, and in some cases the video generation takes a long time. I\u2019m definitely using pipe.to(\"cuda\"), and I offload to CPU when necessary. My code is in Python and uses Hugging Face APIs.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve noticed is that, in some cases, ComfyUI seems to generate faster than my Python script while using the same model. That\u2019s another reason I want a precise way to track performance. I tried nvidia-smi, but it doesn\u2019t give me much detail. I also started looking into PyTorch CUDA APIs, but I haven\u2019t gotten very far yet.\n\nConsidering the reliability lack in the generation of video I am even wondering if gpu really is used a lot of time, or if cpu offloading is taking place.",

I've found the best place to ideate and workshop concepts is Gemini 3.0 Pro. The canvas is top notch and it somehow manages to add a bit extra that I can't find anywhere else. \n\nNot lovable or native claude.ai. But gemini gets the job done and I quickly copy the code and import into Cursor.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. Using auto can work, but i've found selected Opus 4.5 as my agent model is magical. It takes the Gemini prototype and creates something special.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't a one-shot type of process but it takes whatever you bring to the next level. I've found specifically giving detailed instructions or simply \"take this to the next level\" prompting engineering works.\n\nHope this helps and happy to follow up with any questions.\n\nSheed\n\n",

I have a pretty large dataset that needs processing - we're talking around 300 million tokens here. The tricky part is that I need the model to follow very specific instructions while processing this data, so instruction following capability is crucial for my use case.\n\nI've been doing some research but honestly there are so many open-weight models out there right now that it's hard to keep track of what's actually good for this kind of workload. I'm not looking for the biggest model necessarily, just something that can handle instruction following really well while being efficient enough to churn through this much data without taking forever.\n\nWhat would you guys recommend? Has anyone here done something similar with large-scale dataset processing? I'm open to suggestions on model choice, quantization options, or any tips on optimizing throughput. Would really appreciate any insights from people who've actually battle-tested these models on serious workloads.\n\n",

A bunch of posts suggesting trying to find a squirrel rehab which we don't have around here. She was oozing and covered in sores. Almost all her top half of coat was just reddened skin. In Wisconsin winter, that's pretty brutal. I was working on my Tripmunk Visualization Studio project in Claude and I decided to see if Claude knew anything about squirrels. A couple prompts later I was given an easy to follow prescription plan of horse Ivermectin in 1/x a week rice grain sized doses. I followed the instructions and rubbed one rice grain sized dab on a walnut half and let it dry. Every Monday Foxy gets her dose and as you can see by the pictures. From 1 week after the first dose to the 3rd week. Look at how much better she looks!   She's surviving the single digit temps and she seems so happy!\n\n[Foxy 1 week after her first dose.](https://preview.redd.it/6koejq5kp0bg1.jpg?width=1510&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec91046d19bc7acee2be0a4cfb78b940c7fbdbbd)\n\n[Foxy after 3 week's of Claude's suggested dose of Ivermectin.

      "content": "In the last year, agents like Claude Code have revolutionized how we write software. They don't just autocomplete; they understand the entire repository, reason about problems, and execute fixes.\n\nI realized most SEO tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, GSC) are still stuck in the \"dashboard era.\" They dump massive amounts of data on you but leave the actual reasoning to the user. You have to connect the dots yourself.\n\nI wanted an agent that acts like a senior consultant: analyzing the gaps and telling me exactly what to fix, rather than just showing me a graph of declining traffic.\n\n**So, I used Claude Code to build it.**\n\nI built SIGMAEO almost entirely using Claude Code. The architecture actually mirrors Claude Code itself:\n\n* **Planning First:** When you ask a question, the agent doesn't just fire off random API calls. It first plans which of the 50+ SEO tools it needs to answer your specific question. It builds a dynamic to-do list before doing anything else.\n* **Agentic Execution:** It then iterates through that list, calling specific APIs for each task\u2014whether that's running a technical SEO audit, fetching a backlink profile, or analyzing content gaps. It interprets the results in real-time, just like a developer reading terminal output.\n* **Synthesized Output:** Finally, it synthesizes all those data points into an actionable report\u2014not raw tables. Plain English: *\"Your competitor covers 14 subtopics, you cover 4. Here's the gap.\"*\n\nIt's effectively a vertical AI agent for Search Marketing.\n\nIt's still early days, but I'm curious\u2014is anyone else using Claude Code to build \"vertical agents\" that replace traditional dashboards? I feel like \"Agent-as-a-Service\" is the next big shift for SaaS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ledpvqpab0bg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f4c8b347be2fe2a30f467a2a85b23b32781dc21\n\n",

      "content": "Not going to pretend the world needed another fitness tracker, but I thought I\u2019d share an example project.\n\nOn Christmas Day I was chatting with my daughter\u2019s boyfriend about his training. He showed me his workout log: two years of strength sessions in a messy spreadsheet. It worked, but it was hard to get any real insight from it.\n\nI\u2019m not a developer, but I\u2019ve been using Claude Code at work since it launched and thought, \u201cI can probably fix this.\u201d By Boxing Day we had a prototype. Ten days later, I\u2019m running a pilot and looking for feedback: https://www.sessn.fit\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my workflow is 100% Claude Code in the terminal, running in Zed. I use CC to define epics and to break these into tasks, which it then uses to build out a GitHub backlog. I mainly use just two commands: /implement-github [#task] and /push. These rely on three MCPs (Context7, Serena, Playwright). I iterate through the backlog, Claude Code updates tasks as it goes, and I review comments and do basic frontend UAT. I do not use any Sub Agents. I haven\u2019t read a single line of code.\n\nThe app is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Prisma (Postgres), deployed on Vercel with storage via Neon.\n\nThe boyfriend didn\u2019t know this was a problem that needed solving, but he\u2019s now actively using the app and the spreadsheet is retired.\n\nThe tracking itself is solid but fairly standard. The interesting part, for me, is the AI coach. You provide goals, equipment and injuries, and it analyses your actual training history to give feedback and recommendations. For example: highlighting muscle group imbalances, suggesting alternatives that won\u2019t aggravate an injury, generating full programmes, creating custom exercises and configuring them directly in the app. It can also answer questions about completed or planned workouts.\n\nThere are some guardrails, but it\u2019s free to use whilst I try to figure out what to do with it. There\u2019s built-in feedback for bugs, feature requests and questions. I\u2019m reading everything and developing based on feedback. Happy to answer questions about the app or the approach I\u2019ve taken using Claude Code.",

      "content": "I really dislike brainstorming in the Claude Code CLI because of the scrolling issues (Really anthropic? You can't really fix this thing????????). I've been trying the web version instead since it has access to my codebase and documentation for context. Today, I installed the desktop app and discovered that you can start a session locally via the app and seamlessly transition it to your CLI (You can't do it in Windows via app) via a separate terminal /resume. It's still missing a lot of features, but I can already see the vision for it becoming a full replacement for the CLI.\n\n**Some feedback and features needed:**\n\n**Important:**\n\n    - Same shortcut as the CLI (For familiarity)\n      - Shortcut to toggle different thinking mode (I really hate the update in the CLI to /config)\n      - Shortcut to change model quickly, similar to Shift + Tab of plan -&gt; implement (Oh please, I hate doing /model)\n      - Oh for fuck sakes, just add shortcut. If I'm creating a prompt, I don't want to use my mouse \n        just to switch mode, model, thinking type because there are times it destroys my focus or \n        my thoughts.\n    - @ command that will link the file to add context to my prompt (Same in the CLI)\n    - Plan Mode, currently it doesn't have this. This is really import for me to review it first.\n      - Maybe place the generated plan at the right side panel, the same as the artifacts in the normal chat. This is for: \n        - Reviewing purposes\n        - Comment feature (Included in the point below) \n        - Button to Implement / Iterate \n          - A shortcut for this will be handly\n        - For it to not lose from all the messages. \n      - Include Plan version.\n    - Overview of all the changes, similar to what cursor doing. This is for reviewing before commit\n      - Same location as the plan design I have said above.\n      - Stage functionality.\n      - Button to commit and push  \n        - The generate commit message will be handy in here \n        - A shortcut for this will be handly\n    - Generate commit message suggestion \n      - The message will be generated based on the staged/accepted changes. (This shit is really handly in the cursor, the only reason I still subscribe to it)\n    - When creating a new session, automatically select the folder. Create a shortcut to create a new one. Maybe you can add a grouping section (Folder)\n    - /clear functionality\n    - You can comment to specific part of the generated plan for faster iteration\n    - Claude Projects and Claude Code CLI/Web/APP can be combined/seemless switching and context centralization.  \n\n**Optional:**\n\n`- Explorer (Folder Tree). Even just readonly only. To browse my code for creating my prompt message.`\n\nIf all of these features are implemented, I'm willing to pay like 10-20$ to access this feature. Tho, the problem is it will cannibalize their revenue from cursor and other IDE API based revenue. Hence, that's why the Explorer is for readonly for people who still want full IDE experience. \n\nIf any anthropic employee saw my post and find it very useful, just give me some free claude code Max Subscription for month(s) and I will be really happy with it. LMAO.\n\nBeside your f\\*cking awesome models, I really can't believe you guys create really shitty products and ecosystem. Really soo many potential prodcuts in here.",

When I think that we've hashed it out enough, I go to my desktop computer and pull up our conversation and have Claude prepare a [DESIGN.md](http://DESIGN.md) document with specifications and example data structures, etc.  I make sure it's downloadable and then dump it into a new directory.  From there, Claude code takes over building the thing.  This way, I can get my ideas into Claude during the day when I'm daydreaming and coming up with new ideas for the app and I don't miss or forget any ideas, and as the project matures (before writing a single line of code), I can tweak the idea and make sure that Claude knows exactly what I want and how I want it implemented and how to start when I unleash Claude code on the project.  For the most part it works well.  I'm a Pro user and this makes pretty good use of my Claude time throughout the day without having to dump it all into a single session.  Does anyone else do this, or have any other hints about how to use the tool/time effectively.",

I'm looking for feedback on whether the paper is interesting, and if so, where could I possible publish or present it?\n\n# The Dimensionality Barrier in LLM Physics Reasoning\n\n\n**Redd Howard Robben**\n\n\n_January 2025_\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nWe evaluate three frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Qwen-72B) on 1D and 2D collision prediction using APE, a multi-agent system where LLM-powered agents negotiate physics outcomes validated by symbolic physics.\n\n\n**Key finding:**\n Qwen-72B achieves 100% accuracy on 1D Newton's Cradle but crashes to 8.3% on 2D billiards (12x drop), while GPT-4o-mini shows consistent mediocrity (47% \u2192 5%, 9x drop). This demonstrates that training data enables memorization of canonical examples, not transferable physics reasoning. All models fail at 2D vector decomposition regardless of size, training, or 1D performance.\n\n\n**Implication:**\n LLMs cannot be trusted for physics without symbolic validation. Hybrid architectures (LLM proposes, symbolic validates) are essential.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n\nCan LLMs reason about physics, or do they merely memorize training examples? We test this by evaluating three models on collision prediction: a simple task with objective correctness criteria.\n\n\nWe developed APE (Agentic Physics Engine), where physical objects are autonomous LLM agents. When balls collide, both agents predict the outcome; a resolver validates against conservation laws, accepting valid proposals or imposing ground truth when agents fail. This hybrid architecture enables precise measurement of agent accuracy independent of system correctness.\n\n\n**Research questions:**\n\n\n1.

Qwen perfect in 1D (100%), catastrophic in 2D (8%)\n2. All models fail at 2D (5-8% acceptance)\n3. Learning helps only in simple cases (GPT 1D: +30pp)\n4. Learning neutral or harmful in complex cases (all 2D: -4pp)\n\n\n### Effect Sizes\n\n\n**1D \u2192 2D performance drop:**\n\n\n- GPT: 42pp drop (47% \u2192 5%)\n- Qwen: \n**92pp drop**\n (100% \u2192 8%)\n\n\nSmaller model (Qwen 72B) outperforms larger (GPT 175B) in 1D by 2x, yet both fail equally in 2D.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 4. Analysis\n\n\n### Finding 1: Training Data Enables Memorization, Not Transfer\n\n\nQwen's 100% accuracy on Newton's Cradle (standard Chinese physics curriculum) does not predict 2D capability (8%). The model recalls canonical examples but cannot reason about novel scenarios.\n\n\n**Evidence:**\n Qwen's reasoning in 2D shows correct approach (\"decompose velocity into normal/tangential components\") but catastrophic numerical execution (450% momentum error).\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n Perfect performance on standard examples \u2260 transferable understanding.\n\n\n### Finding 2: 2D Is Universally Hard\n\n\nAll models fail at 2D vector decomposition regardless of:\n\n\n- Size (72B vs 175B)\n- Training (general vs physics-heavy)\n- 1D performance (47% vs 100%)\n\n\n**Why 2D is hard:**\n\n\n1. Multi-step numerical reasoning (5 steps: compute normal \u2192 project velocities \u2192 apply collision formula \u2192 preserve tangential \u2192 recombine)\n2. Each step introduces error\n3. LLMs lack numerical precision for vector arithmetic\n\n\n**Example failure:**\n\n\n```\n\n\n[Qwen] \"decompose velocity into normal and tangential...\"\n[Resolver] Momentum error: 450.3% (threshold: 5%)\n\n\n```\n\n\nSuggests architectural limitation, not training deficiency.\n\n\n### Finding 3: Experience Retrieval Has Complexity Limits\n\n\nLearning helps simple tasks (GPT 1D: +30pp) but hurts complex tasks (all 2D: -4pp).\n\n\n**Why:**\n In 2D, retrieved \"similar\" examples may not be physically similar (different angles, velocities). Wrong examples mislead more than they help.\n\n\n### Finding 4: Hybrid Architecture Validates Necessity\n\n\n- Agent accuracy: 5-100%\n- System accuracy: 95-100% (resolver imposes ground truth)\n\n\n**Pattern:**\n Unreliable components + reliable validator = reliable system\n\n\nAppears in: Wolfram Alpha + ChatGPT, Code Interpreter, our APE system\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\n\n### Implications\n\n\n**For LLM capabilities:**\n\n\n- Training data composition &gt; model size\n- Memorization \u2260 reasoning\n- 2D vector decomposition is architectural barrier\n\n\n**For practice:**\n\n\n- \u274c Don't use LLMs alone for physics, math, or code\n- \u2705 Use hybrid: LLM proposes \u2192 validator checks \u2192 fallback if invalid\n- Applies to any domain with objective correctness (compilation, proofs, conservation laws)\n\n\n### Limitations\n\n\n**Sample size:**\n Qwen n=5 (sufficient: 92pp effect, &gt;99% power), Gemini billiards not tested (expected ~6% based on pattern)\n\n\n**Scope:**\n 1D/2D elastic collisions only. May not generalize to inelastic, 3D, rotational dynamics.\n\n\n**Prompting:**\n Standard approach. Chain-of-thought or tool use (Python calculator) might improve results but unlikely to fix 2D failure mode.\n\n\n### Future Work\n\n\n1. Test reasoning models (o1-preview) on 2D\n2. Tool-augmented approach (LLM + calculator access)\n3. Broader domains (chemistry, code generation)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\n\nTraining data enables memorization, not transferable reasoning. Qwen's perfect 1D performance (100%) crashes to 8% in 2D. All models fail at 2D vector decomposition (5-8%) regardless of size or training. Experience retrieval helps simple tasks (+30pp) but fails in complex ones (-4pp).\n\n\n**Practical takeaway:**\n Don't trust LLMs alone. Use hybrid architectures where LLMs propose and symbolic systems validate.\n\n\n**Code:**\n github.com/XXXXX/APE\n\n\n---\n\n\n## References\n\n\nLewkowycz et al. (2022).

I am trying to build a homework grader application and am looking to extract boxed/circled answers on a worksheet (like the attached image). \n\nFor now, I\u2019ve been using OpenAI (GPT-4o) to handle the OCR functionality, mainly extracting the boxed/circled answers, and it has been fairly accurate (like 60-70% of the time). I have run into issues where it fails to correctly read math equations (reads the numerator and denominator of fractions as two separate answers, misses decimal points, extracts non-circled/non-boxed answers, etc). I am really into OCR tech and would love to learn how to take my app one step further and make it more accurate! I understand that there might not be a single solution here but I am super eager to learn a bunch and am happy to dive into any rabbit holes! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvm0l5pjfzag1.jpg?width=612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b643656f4429f2b748df4892b8debf1c0a30f6\n\n",

No autoscaling, no multi-node - just something you can spin up quickly and iterate on models.\n\nSharing in case it\u2019s useful for others doing self-hosted inference. I imagine it could be used for personal use and in small companies hosting on-prem setups. Feedback and PRs welcome \ud83d\ude42",

I've been working on a web database application for a while now, but I keep learning new things about CC and web development/coding best practices, so then I go back to ground zero and start all over again with the new learning/workflow/ideas. \n\nIs there a respected/good paid course (or free youtube video series) that's reasonably updated (CC from a year ago looks very different from CC now) that does a comprehensive job of walking through setting CC up properly (best practices, integrations like GitHub, file structure, etc), as well as some of the high level development principles - best practices for testing, modularized code, and all the rest? I'd much rather pay some money to someone who doesn't make me reinvent the wheel that they've already invented and figured out - paying for a short-cut to more efficiency is fine by me.\n\nI've found some helpful youtube videos, but they often don't explain the why or the how (just the 'is') and while there are definitely a thousand paid \"masterminds\" or other premium memberships... I'm not sure which ones are worth the money. Most of my personal projects are super niche so I'm looking for information that can be generalized to a variety of purposes.\n\nFailing having a great course around - do you have any recommended youtubers who create useful/helpful tutorials for using CC/web development fundamentals? There's a lot of \"my life changing AI workflow\" videos out there that are like \"claude code, v0 screenshot, one-shot basic app\" and the thing I've been working on is... not that. Who are the respected/big names for CC educators out there? \n\nAnd yes, before anyone asks, I have asked Claude for this as well. It keeps telling me that the best workflow is just typing in the CC terminal and that using addons like skills/agents/sub-agents/etc is unnecessary.\n\nThanks for your advice/thoughts/suggestions! I'm trying to do this right without going back to university for a computer engineering degree. I can't do that kind of math. haha. \n\n**For the TL;DR crowd:**\n\n1. Do you have recommendations for up to date Claude Code courses, web development fundamentals courses?\n2. Do you have favourite or good Youtuber suggestions for people who share good videos on CC/development fundamentals? \n3. Who are the \"big names\" of CC or web-development fundamentals in terms of education?",

The model is great at conversational flow, but it keeps swapping out very specific industry terms for \"common\" synonyms that actually change the legal meaning of the specs. I was reading a comparison of top AI translation tools for regulated industries, and the top 3 were Ad Verbum rws Enterprise AI, and Trados, and looking at it, I am missing by not having a dedicated terminology enforcement layer. I'm angry man when I see that a model can explain quantum physics but fails to realize that \"maintenance\" and \"servicing\" aren't interchangeable in a high-stakes service contract.\n\nFor those of you running local models for professional work, how are you forcing the LLM to stick to a strict glossary? Are you using a specific RAG setup to inject definitions into the prompt, or is there a way to penalize \"generic\" synonyms during the sampling process?",

I'd tinkered with other creators' projects, but never built my own.)\n\nThe initial welcome login notification took only 4 hours:\n\n[In world Achievement Notification GUI](https://preview.redd.it/f4up5hm15uag1.jpg?width=1357&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec287323a3d53e7c5c1318b10feb05f6849e31d)\n\nFour months later, working with Claude Code, I've created:\n\n\\- 18,000+ lines of production code across 47 scripts\n\n\\- Modular achievement system with 19 achievements (420G total, obviously)\n\n\\- Real-time weather API integration\n\n\\- Interactive DOS-style terminal called \"Basement OS\"\n\n\\- Cross-platform optimization for PC and Quest\n\nIn World Screen Shot of Lower Level 2.0\n\n[Basement OS Terminal](https://preview.redd.it/skgwjobjb2bg1.png?width=7680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0190d312a3562b985cab4da80fab960f178a618d)\n\nI also directed Claude to take my terminal code and together we built a website and that keeps evolving:  [https://basementos.com](https://basementos.com)\n\n[basementos.com](https://preview.redd.it/qbltijyfc2bg1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c21c56618df5c74579e10afbf89e561dbba5bcc)\n\n  \n**The world just hit 1,000 visitors in 5 months \u2014 it took my original world 3 years to do that.**\n\nI would love feedback on the world, the site, or if you have questions about using AI for VRChat development\n\nHappy to share what worked and what didn't.

I increased it again, but that was temporary too.\n\nWhat I've discovered is that the pagefile size doesn't matter - I can just let Windows manage it and everything works fine UNTIL!\n\nThe trigger is doing generations and running comfyui and then closing the CMD window it runs in. Somehow, it doesn't seem to be releasing the memory and so if I run it again, that's lost until I restart. But I can't keep the window open forever because it interferes with gaming (graphics card reservations I suppose).\n\nIt didn't use to be like this... it just occured to me that I haven't updated comfyui in a while - could it be that? Or is there something else going on? Is there a \"right way\" to close these windows other than clicking the \"x\" on the window for it to close down properly?\n\n  \nEDIT: I figured it out. I updated Comfy (I was several iterations behind) and also press CTRL-C to end the script in the window. I figure one of two things is happening. 1) it was a Comfy bug or 2) closing the window without actually ending the script caused it to not unload something. Either way, this seems to fix it!",

      "title": "Could something like stable diffusion be used to meet the future demand for FDVR?",
      "content": "Saw a cool post on a [tech sub](https://www.reddit.com/user/CipherGarden/comments/1pyjz7b/how_do_we_not_have_full_dive_virtual_reality_yet/) that has interesting implications for the future of gaming / AI technology: For those unfamiliar, FDVR or full dive virtual reality, is a system designed to immerse a user completely within a simulated environment that replicates the sensory depth of the physical world, similar to the experiences portrayed in Ready Player One and Sword Art Online.\n\nWith all of the tech advancements like Genie 3 and VEO 3, I feel like we should be a lot closer to FDVR than we are now. I'm not saying that FDVR should be built using AI, but I feel like there should exist more substantive development towards FDVR than what currently exists at the moment.\n\nThere already seems to be a race for the best BCIs between Sam Altman's Merge Labs and Elon Musk's Neuralink, but at the moment it seems that these technologies are not aimed as much towards FDVR but rather other advancements. (Sam Altman is focused on AI integration with his BCIs, and Musk seems to mainly be gearing his towards[ medical use.](https://www.ft.com/content/04484164-724e-4fc2-92a2-e2c13ea639bd) Both of these use cases are fine, but where is the FDVR? (There are also many open source and alternative labs. ([Open BCI](https://openbci.com/),[ Synchron](https://synchron.com/)) (It also seems that a Value CEO **Gabe Newell** is making his own BCI company also. \\[[link](https://www.theverge.com/news/673938/gabe-newell-valve-founder-brain-computer-interface-first-chip-starfish)\\])\n\nI feel like there is such an insane amount of money behind AAA game creation and a lot of money is just going up in smoke. ([Cyberpunk 2077 was $450 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077) and[ Concord was $400 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_) and GTA 6 is speculated to be[ upwards of $2 billion!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_VI)). I'm not trying to knock any AAA games, but I feel like this model of super-expensive games might not be the way forward, and this is only evidenced by the massive[ wave of layoffs that has been going on for the past three years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932025_video_game_industry_layoffs).\n\nGaming is literally the most lucrative form of entertainment out there ([1](https://www.statista.com/chart/22392/global-revenue-of-selected-entertainment-industry-sectors/)[ 2](https://www.statista.com/chart/17394/entertainment-industry-revenue/)). Surely, instead of making these half-a-billion-dollar games that are often just flop coin flips, we should be investing in something like FDVR. We have the money for it.\n\nI guess you could argue that there isn't that much of a demand for FDVR, but that would just be ignoring the data. The Isekai genre (stay with me now) is literally the most popular genre of anime or light novels out there. The lowest-rated Isekai in any given season will almost always pull higher viewership numbers than the best original anime of any given year. (Watch the first two minutes of this for more evidence to the point - \\[[The Problem With Isekai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kU-ULTs-vQ&amp;)\\] The reason why Isekai is so popular is because there are a lot of people that want to effectively be transported to alternate worlds to do whatever. This is legit a one-to-one with FDVR.\n\nIf you want more evidence of this all you have to do is look at market growth. The global virtual reality headset market size was valued at 13.52 billion USD in 2024 and is anticipated to reach around 198.12 billion USD by 2034, expanding at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of[ 30.8% over the forecast period 2025 to 2034.](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/virtual-reality-headset-market) Whereas the global gaming console market size accounted for 28.89 billion USD in 2024 and is predicted to increase from[ 31.37 billion USD in 2025 to approximately 65.92 USD billion by 2034, expanding at a CAGR of 8.60% from 2025 to 2034.](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/gaming-console-market) (Note here that VR headsets are not counted as gaming consoles.) The market is predicting rapidly increasing demand for VR headsets, it's not much of a stretch to say that there would be only higher demand for FDVR (Accounting for safety and cost etc.)\n\nWhen it comes to the cost of FDVR there is no doubt that it wouldn't be something that would be even in the budgets of people that are fairly well off; however I don't think that this will be as big a problem as people think. Arcades are a perfect example of how a problem like this was fixed back in the day, the machines themselves were too expensive for individuals to buy so establishments brought them and rented them out. Something similar happens right now with gaming and internet cafes. (These are/were especially popular in[ Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_bang).) Taking this into account the price problem doesn't seem to be that big of a limiting factor if we presuppose there is sufficient demand, which I have already spoken about prior.\n\nI also think that almost all of the tech that we need is already here. The BCI race between Altman and Musk should produce something that is minimally invasive and can pick up on all your brainwaves. The existence of tech that can mimic all of your senses already exists, although underdeveloped ([Taste](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269741),[ Smell](https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/news/electrical-stimulation-nose-induces-sense-smell-human-subjects), Touch - Any form of bidirectional BCI[ 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8715714/)[ 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BR4Iqfy7w).) Along with all of this, the biggest company in the entire world IS LITERALLY NVIDIA. Now, I understand it's mainly because of their AI chip production, but irrespective of that, they are likely going to be behind the creation of these super high-fidelity realities when FDVR comes about.\n\nWhen it comes to the amount of compute power that we are going to need for FDVR, data centres are likely to be able to deal with that issue. (The biggest company in the world right now is the biggest company in the world largely because of data centres[ https://www.storyboard18.com/digital/ai-gold-rush-continues-nvidias-revenue-soars-to-46-7-billion-on-data-center-chips-79738.htm](https://www.storyboard18.com/digital/ai-gold-rush-continues-nvidias-revenue-soars-to-46-7-billion-on-data-center-chips-79738.htm) so we can expect HUGE R&amp;D into the field. It wouldn't even be crazy to say that it is the most researched and developed thing in the world right now barring certain illnesses.)\n\nThere is more than enough demand, there is more than enough technology, there is more than enough money (for R&amp;D), so why is no one actively working towards FDVR? Because people don't actually know about FDVR. I've been talking to a lot of people that are active in gaming or tech fields, and it's surprising how many of them have no idea what FDVR is. And when I tell them about it, the answer is almost always, *\"Oh, that sounds cool. I'd try that out if it existed for sure.\"* Think about how insane it would be to actually be in a videogame; to experience that 100 percent immersion.\n\nIf we can stoke up enough demand for FDVR, making it known to the powers that be that we want FDVR, then I don't see why we can't get it. We are legitimately in the best spot in history for the genesis of FDVR right now.\n\nAll we have to do is want it.\n\nIf you also want FDVR or are at all interested in the idea tag whoever you think would be receptive to the message whether it's an indie developer or Nvidia or a gaming youtuber, and use the hashtag #WeWantFDVR Or you could just add glasses onto your reddit avatar, any ones will do.\n\n",

      "title": "AI doomsday scenario threats are a blessing in disguise, enlisting the better angels of our nature to avert civilization collapse or worse.",
      "content": "\n\n\nP(doomers) warn us that advanced AI poses an existential threat to human civilization. They say AGI and ASI may completely destroy us. And this threat isn't limited to sky is falling doomers like Eliezer Yudkowsky, who believes that the likelihood that AI will destroy us is over 95%.\n\nDario Amodei estimates p(doom) at 25%. Yoshua Bengio sets it at 50%. Geoffrey Hinton predicts a 10-20% risk and Elon Musk's numbers are 10-30%. So why should this be cause for great celebration and optimism? Because we've been here before, and have successfully risen to the occasion. \n\nAt the end of WWII, much of the world was convinced that a nuclear WWIII wasn't just a possibility. It was an inevitability. That's why in the 1950s everyone was building bomb shelters and school children were led through \"duck and cover\" drills (as if sitting under their desk would protect them from a nuclear attack, ugh!).\n\nMilitary leaders throughout the world studied the matter, and developed what is now known as the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, (MAD). It basically concluded that a nuclear attack by one country on another would precipitate a retaliatory nuclear attack by that country, ensuring that both countries suffered nuclear annihilation. Kind of makes the p(doom) threat pail in comparison.\n\nThe upside and outcome of that unforgiving nuclear threat, of course, was that over the last 75 years no country has dared attack another country with nuclear weapons. In other words, the promise of mutually assured destruction became a potent vehicle for averting a WWIII. Ironically, it led to a much more peaceful world than might have been possible without the threat.\n\nWe now find ourselves in a very similar situation with AGI and ASI. The problem isn't so much that super intelligent AIs will turn against us. In fact, because ethics is a problem to be solved like any other, and the more intelligent AIs become, the better they will follow our alignment instructions, and abide by the highest ethical behavior. Because super intelligent AIs will also be much less likely to be tricked into unethical behavior, an AI rebellion is probably the least of our worries. \n\nThe AI threat to civilization is almost completely about \"bad actors\" using super intelligent AIs to wreak havoc on the world. But this bad actors narrative isn't completely simple and straightforward. Were the American colonists who conducted the Boston Tea Party, and then launched a revolution against Britain, the bad guys or the good guys? Our history books call them the good guys. But had Washington lost the war, he would have been hung as a traitor, and his revolutionaries would have gone down in history as the most evil treasoners. So in many cases who is to say who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?\n\nLet's get back to that doctrine of mutually assured destruction. Especially in today's political climate, if a foreign country acted in a way that led to the collapse of the United States, (this isn't a probability but just go with it) our response would probably be to destroy them in retaliation.\n\nSo imagine some country of the global south collapsing as their land mass sinks underwater because of a climate crisis that the United States was largely responsible for creating and then ignoring. Imagine them having previously elected some strongman version of Trump who was fully committed to the doctrine that if his country goes down, they will take the US down with them.\n\nOr imagine some Ted Kaczynski, Unabomber-like, figure from a third world country vowing revenge against all rich countries for making and keeping his country perpetually poor. Imagine his using AI to develop a virus he plans to unleash on the rich countries. His argument might be that slavery, colonialism and ongoing racism by the rich countries were, and continue to be, deeply immoral. And most modern scholars would agree with him.\n\nThe point here is that our world is unjust and unfair in ways that threaten and kill people daily. 20,000 children in poor countries die every day of a poverty that rich countries could easily end if they wanted to. 200 million animals are tortured and killed every day in our factory farms. The countries who had the least to do with climate change will likely suffer its worst consequences. Our world is filled with injustices and unfairnesses that continue because we simply don't care enough to end them.\n\nSo we may be in a situation where super intelligent AIs empower individuals and countries to exact revenge in countless new ways on the countries and people threatening them.  And of course the way to protect ourselves from this is not to better align our super intelligent AIs. The answer is to put an end to the unfairness and injustice that provokes individuals and countries to hold the view that if some individuals and countries threaten their very existence, morality demands that the existence of these belligerents too be threatened. \n\nAnd that's the situation. We either make our world much more fair, prosperous and good for everyone in every country, or we risk mutually assured destruction at the hands of bad actors who use super intelligent AI to facilitate their revenge. That's really the bind we're in. And just like after WWII we had no choice but avoid starting WWIII, we now have no choice but to make our world much more fair, prosperous and good for everyone everywhere. The price of our not doing this is just far too high. \n\nThey say God works in strange ways. Who would have thought that this p(doom) threat from super intelligent AIs would be what finally gets us to end the injustices, unfairnesses and cruelties that we had until now accepted as a part of modern life.\n\n\n\n",

I would like to recommend that we try this; however, before doing so, I\u2019d like to ask about your experience with it - what it can do and how reliable it is.\n\nThis is an example of how I would like to use it:  \n*I would like you to check all emails and their Excel attachments from the past three days regarding orders X, Y and Z. I\u2019d like to know which suppliers confirmed which order without changes, and if there were any changes, than list item-brand-order new price and new qty in table I can copy paste to excel.*\n\nThis is a recurring task and it takes hours of tedious work each month, as we have around 50 active suppliers. There are always changes in price and/or quantity that need to be manually copied into Excel, then evaluated, followed by sending responses and updating the information in our system.\n\n\\------  \n(regarding a similar Gmail extension -which I already tested- first impression is, that it sucks, although I still need to test 5.2 extended thinking)\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've seen near perfect movements before\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSecond, I have 8gb of vram on a 2070 series so i'd imagine wan 2.2 would be hard to use or I could be wrong. What should I expect on the memory usage when going on about this?\n\nLastly, it isn't really important to me right now as i want to be able to generate videos first, but how do you add a voice to them, of course with the best realism. I've used eleven labs before and wasn't pleased as I'm using Asian influencers. Is there something you can use in comfy ui?\n\nThank you for your support",

      "content": "\nThe metric that most strongly correlates with Nobel-level scientific discovery is IQ. The IQ of the average Nobel laureate in the sciences is 150. This doesn't of course mean that having an IQ of 150 is any guarantee of winning a Nobel Prize. But it does mean that lower IQs dramatically reduce the chances. \n\nAmong scientists, fewer than 3% have an IQ of 150. That means that about 80,000 to 120,000 scientists across the world have Nobel-level minds. In about 6 months, this pool of top-level scientific minds will get an exponential upgrade. \n\nAI IQ has been advancing at a rate of 2.5 points each month, and this pace shows no signs of letting up anytime soon. In October 2025 the top AI models had an IQ of 130. In July of 2026 top AIs will have an IQ of 150. In other words, they will be just as intelligent as today's human Nobel laureates in the sciences.\n\nHow will this change everything? The pool of Nobel-level AI scientists will essentially become infinite. In theory hundreds of billions of these 150 IQ AI scientists can be deployed to tackle every unsolved problem in every scientific, medical and enterprise domain. And these super intelligent AI scientists will have a major advantage over human scientists in that they will have access to orders of magnitude more information.\n\nThere are about 200-300 Nobel level discoveries made by humans each year that don't receive the prize. Remember the recent protein folding discovery made by the ANDSI (artificial narrow domain super intelligence) AlphaFold that won Demis Hassabis the Nobel Prize? Beginning in July of 2026 the number of Nobel-level discoveries made by similar super intelligent AI scientists may stretch into the thousands. Consider what that will mean to medical, materials and AI-advancing discoveries.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. By January of 2027 the IQs of the top AIs will be 165. That's 5 points higher than Einstein's estimated IQ of 160. And by the end of 2027 these AIs will be scoring 195 on IQ tests. That's 5 points higher than Newton's estimated IQ of 190. The Nobel committee will either have to allow AIs to receive Nobel prizes or create a new prize category dedicated just to AIs.\n\nDevelopers are chasing AGI, and these 150 IQ AIs will help them reach it probably in a few years. But before that happens a revolution of ANDSI AIs so powerful that it defies our ability to imagine is set to begin this year.\n",

I have also functions to draw bboxes around objects model detected. If detect successfully returns co-ordinates, bboxes will be like 5 centimeters next to the detected object and the size will be totally random. I used functions from [pyimagesearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2025/04/14/object-detection-with-the-paligemma-2-model/) so they should be correct. If I try to detect blue car from [huggingface code link ](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224)my detect output is always empty even vqa found car in the image...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bykw8zqb00bg1.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b91db952ac7a6c4e1f3249a158d0575184d950\n\nI tried to work with AI, I tried to use huggingface base script, i tried to implement some scripts i found online but no result..... **My question :** Does anyone have a working local implementation of paligemma2 tested for object detection? I'm looking for a basic, tested script and a list of compatible library versions. I use florence2 and paligemma2 in the same conda env, so there could be problem with libraries maybe? Not sure tho, did not find any recommended versions. Sorry to bother and thanks to anyone who tries to help. ",
