I think this community's expertise is exactly what I need.</p>\n<p><strong>The project:</strong> I've built an educational platform for Grades 1-10 aimed at students who can't afford tutoring or premium EdTech subscriptions. Currently it runs on Google AI Studio API keys (free tier), which works for limited usage but isn't sustainable or truly \"free as in freedom.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The goal:</strong> I want to transition to local LLMs so the platform can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-hosted by schools/NGOs in low-resource settings</li>\n<li>Truly free with no API costs or usage caps</li>\n<li>Private (student data never leaves the local network)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Where I need help:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Model recommendations</strong> - What would you suggest for educational Q&amp;A, explanation generation, and...</p>"
