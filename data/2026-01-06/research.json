      "content": "When AI systems explain their reasoning step-by-step, practitioners often assume these explanations reveal what actually influenced the AI's answer. We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.",

By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.",

      "content": "This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.",

      "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines.",

      "content": "We investigate whether large language models can introspect on their internal states. It is difficult to answer this question through conversation alone, as genuine introspection cannot be distinguished from confabulations. Here, we address this challenge by injecting representations of known concepts into a model's activations, and measuring the influence of these manipulations on the model's self-reported states. We find that models can, in certain scenarios, notice the presence of injected concepts and accurately identify them. Models demonstrate some ability to recall prior internal representations and distinguish them from raw text inputs. Strikingly, we find that some models can use their ability to recall prior intentions in order to distinguish their own outputs from artificial prefills. In all these experiments, Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, the most capable models we tested, generally demonstrate the greatest introspective awareness; however, trends across models are complex and sensitive to post-training strategies. Finally, we explore whether models can explicitly control their internal representations, finding that models can modulate their activations when instructed or incentivized to \"think about\" a concept. Overall, our results indicate that current language models possess some functional introspective awareness of their own internal states. We stress that in today's models, this capacity is highly unreliable and context-dependent; however, it may continue to develop with further improvements to model capabilities.",

      "content": "As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While \\textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \\textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \\textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \\textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \\textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \\textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($\\phi$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \\textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \\textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($\\rho$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as \"Reasoning Theater\" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.",

We propose an approach to enhance planning with JEPA world models by shaping their representation space so that the negative goal-conditioned value function for a reaching cost in a given environment is approximated by a distance (or quasi-distance) between state embeddings.

      "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning from conversational assistants to autonomous agents embedded in critical organizational functions, including Security Operations Centers (SOCs), financial systems, and infrastructure management. Current adversarial testing paradigms focus predominantly on technical attack vectors: prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data exfiltration. We argue this focus is catastrophically incomplete. LLMs, trained on vast corpora of human-generated text, have inherited not merely human knowledge but human \\textit{psychological architecture} -- including the pre-cognitive vulnerabilities that render humans susceptible to social engineering, authority manipulation, and affective exploitation. This paper presents the first systematic application of the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (\\cpf{}), a 100-indicator taxonomy of human psychological vulnerabilities, to non-human cognitive agents. We introduce the \\textbf{Synthetic Psychometric Assessment Protocol} (\\sysname{}), a methodology for converting \\cpf{} indicators into adversarial scenarios targeting LLM decision-making. Our preliminary hypothesis testing across seven major LLM families reveals a disturbing pattern: while models demonstrate robust defenses against traditional jailbreaks, they exhibit critical susceptibility to authority-gradient manipulation, temporal pressure exploitation, and convergent-state attacks that mirror human cognitive failure modes. We term this phenomenon \\textbf{Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance} (AVI) and propose that the security community must urgently develop ``psychological firewalls'' -- intervention mechanisms adapted from the Cybersecurity Psychology Intervention Framework (\\cpif{}) -- to protect AI agents operating in adversarial environments.",

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk.",

Despite rapid progress in scientific Machine Learning (ML) models, a critical bottleneck is the lack of expensive real-world data, resulting in most current models being trained and validated on simulated data. Beyond limiting the development and evaluation of scientific ML, this gap also hinders research into essential tasks such as sim-to-real transfer. We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence. In this work, we hope to provide insights from real-world data, advancing scientific ML toward bridging the sim-to-real gap and real-world deployment.

      "content": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the standard paradigm for domain adaptation, yet it frequently incurs the cost of catastrophic forgetting. In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.",

The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.",

This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

      "content": "Empirical evaluation serves as the primary compass guiding research progress in foundation models. Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets.

CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene.

      "content": "While confidence estimation is a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), current research dominantly focuses on single-turn settings. The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new \"Hinter-Guesser\" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents.",

      "content": "Embodied systems experience the world as 'a symphony of flows': a combination of many continuous streams of sensory input coupled to self-motion, interwoven with the dynamics of external objects. These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

      "content": "We study how delegating pricing to large language models (LLMs) can facilitate collusion in a duopoly when both sellers rely on the same pre-trained model. The LLM is characterized by (i) a propensity parameter capturing its internal bias toward high-price recommendations and (ii) an output-fidelity parameter measuring how tightly outputs track that bias; the propensity evolves through retraining. We show that configuring LLMs for robustness and reproducibility can induce collusion via a phase transition: there exists a critical output-fidelity threshold that pins down long-run behavior. Below it, competitive pricing is the unique long-run outcome. Above it, the system is bistable, with competitive and collusive pricing both locally stable and the realized outcome determined by the model's initial preference. The collusive regime resembles tacit collusion: prices are elevated on average, yet occasional low-price recommendations provide plausible deniability. With perfect fidelity, full collusion emerges from any interior initial condition. For finite training batches of size $b$, infrequent retraining (driven by computational costs) further amplifies collusion: conditional on starting in the collusive basin, the probability of collusion approaches one as $b$ grows, since larger batches dampen stochastic fluctuations that might otherwise tip the system toward competition. The indeterminacy region shrinks at rate $O(1/\\sqrt{b})$.",

In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value \\sigma_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking \\sigma_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks.",

While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical, unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation methods.",

Motivated by these challenges, we propose the first practical univariate time series simulation pipeline which is simultaneously fast enough for on-the-fly data generation and enables notable zero-shot forecasting performance on M-Series and GiftEval benchmarks that capture trend/seasonality/intermittency patterns, typical of industrial forecasting applications across a variety of domains. Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol. Notably, on GiftEval we observe a \"student-beats-teacher\" effect: models trained on our simulations exceed the forecasting accuracy of the AutoARIMA generating processes.",

      "content": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce inaccurate or fabricated information, known as \"hallucinations,\" which compromises their reliability. Existing approaches often train an \"Evil LLM\" to deliberately generate hallucinations on curated datasets, using these induced hallucinations to guide contrastive decoding against a reliable \"positive model\" for hallucination mitigation. However, this strategy is limited by the narrow diversity of hallucinations induced, as Evil LLMs trained on specific error types tend to reproduce only these particular patterns, thereby restricting their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose DHI (Diverse Hallucination Induction), a novel training framework that enables the Evil LLM to generate a broader range of hallucination types without relying on pre-annotated hallucination data. DHI employs a modified loss function that down-weights the generation of specific factually correct tokens, encouraging the Evil LLM to produce diverse hallucinations at targeted positions while maintaining overall factual content. Additionally, we introduce a causal attention masking adaptation to reduce the impact of this penalization on the generation of subsequent tokens. During inference, we apply an adaptive rationality constraint that restricts contrastive decoding to tokens where the positive model exhibits high confidence, thereby avoiding unnecessary penalties on factually correct tokens. Extensive empirical results show that DHI achieves significant performance gains over other contrastive decoding-based approaches across multiple hallucination benchmarks.",

This paper introduces a novel threat where colluding agents steer victim beliefs using only truthful evidence fragments distributed through public channels, without relying on covert communications, backdoors, or falsified documents. By exploiting LLMs' overthinking tendency, we formalize the first cognitive collusion attack and propose Generative Montage: a Writer-Editor-Director framework that constructs deceptive narratives through adversarial debate and coordinated posting of evidence fragments, causing victims to internalize and propagate fabricated conclusions. To study this risk, we develop CoPHEME, a dataset derived from real-world rumor events, and simulate attacks across diverse LLM families. Our results show pervasive vulnerability across 14 LLM families: attack success rates reach 74.4% for proprietary models and 70.6% for open-weights models. Counterintuitively, stronger reasoning capabilities increase susceptibility, with reasoning-specialized models showing higher attack success than base models or prompts. Furthermore, these false beliefs then cascade to downstream judges, achieving over 60% deception rates, highlighting a socio-technical vulnerability in how LLM-based agents interact with dynamic information environments.

      "content": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.",

      "content": "Autoregressive large language models achieve strong results on many benchmarks, but decoding remains fundamentally latency-limited by sequential dependence on previously generated tokens. Diffusion language models (DLMs) promise parallel generation but suffer from a fundamental static-to-dynamic misalignment: Training optimizes local transitions under fixed schedules, whereas efficient inference requires adaptive \"long-jump\" refinements through unseen states. Our goal is to enable highly parallel decoding for DLMs with low number of function evaluations while preserving generation quality. To achieve this, we propose CD4LM, a framework that decouples training from inference via Discrete-Space Consistency Distillation (DSCD) and Confidence-Adaptive Decoding (CAD). Unlike standard objectives, DSCD trains a student to be trajectory-invariant, mapping diverse noisy states directly to the clean distribution. This intrinsic robustness enables CAD to dynamically allocate compute resources based on token confidence, aggressively skipping steps without the quality collapse typical of heuristic acceleration. On GSM8K, CD4LM matches the LLaDA baseline with a 5.18x wall-clock speedup; across code and math benchmarks, it strictly dominates the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, achieving a 3.62x mean speedup while improving average accuracy.

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits.

Developing deep learning models for approximating their solution operators promises not only fast, practical solvers, but may also inspire models that resolve classical learning tasks from a new perspective. In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains.",

While current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through node-level adjustments or coarse suppression, they often overlook the distributed nature of neural information, leading to imprecise interventions. Recognizing that hallucinations propagate through specific forward transmission pathways like an infection, we aim to surgically block this flow using precise structural analysis. To leverage this, we propose Lancet, a novel framework that achieves precise neural intervention by leveraging structural entropy and hallucination difference ratios. Lancet first locates hallucination-prone neurons via gradient-driven contrastive analysis, then maps their propagation pathways by minimizing structural entropy, and finally implements a hierarchical intervention strategy that preserves general model capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations across hallucination benchmark datasets demonstrate that Lancet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our surgical approach to neural intervention.",

In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that simulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented with or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over time. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials divided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI recommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final post-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants followed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the given candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected the gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered participants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase, participants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no counterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when explanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across conditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to male-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty. Our findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended behavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent the adoption of algorithmic bias.",

We then quantify race (African American vs. European American) and gender (women vs. men) associations with valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) across 17 occupations and 7 awards. Sora videos associate European Americans and women more with pleasantness (both d>0.8). Effect sizes correlate with real-world demographic distributions: percent men and White in occupations (r=0.93, r=0.83) and percent male and non-Black among award recipients (r=0.88, r=0.99). Applying explicit debiasing prompts generally reduces effect-size magnitudes, but can backfire: two Black-associated occupations (janitor, postal service) become more Black-associated after debiasing.

To address this, we introduce OpenRT, a unified, modular, and high-throughput red-teaming framework designed for comprehensive MLLM safety evaluation. At its core, OpenRT architects a paradigm shift in automated red-teaming by introducing an adversarial kernel that enables modular separation across five critical dimensions: model integration, dataset management, attack strategies, judging methods, and evaluation metrics. By standardizing attack interfaces, it decouples adversarial logic from a high-throughput asynchronous runtime, enabling systematic scaling across diverse models. Our framework integrates 37 diverse attack methodologies, spanning white-box gradients, multi-modal perturbations, and sophisticated multi-agent evolutionary strategies. Through an extensive empirical study on 20 advanced models (including GPT-5.2, Claude 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro), we expose critical safety gaps: even frontier models fail to generalize across attack paradigms, with leading models exhibiting average Attack Success Rates as high as 49.14%.

      "content": "Transformers excel on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.",

      "content": "The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT",

We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training.",

      "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous agents that participate in online social ecosystems, where interactions are sequential, cumulative, and only partially controlled. While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.   We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.   These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.",

In this work, we look at a critical gap in the calibration of LLMs within multilingual settings, in an attempt to better understand how the data scarcity can potentially lead to different calibration effects and how commonly used techniques can apply in these settings. Our analysis on two multilingual benchmarks, over 29 and 42 languages respectively, reveals that even in low-resource languages, model confidence can increase significantly after instruction-tuning on high-resource language SFT datasets. However, improvements in accuracy are marginal or non-existent, resulting in mis-calibration, highlighting a critical shortcoming of standard SFT for multilingual languages. Furthermore, we observe that the use of label smoothing to be a reasonable method alleviate this concern, again without any need for low-resource SFT data, maintaining better calibration across all languages. Overall, this highlights the importance of multilingual considerations for both training and tuning LLMs in order to improve their reliability and fairness in downstream use.",

The findings indicate that while current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics, they fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity.

While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior.",

Central to the framework is an ELO-based selection mechanism enabling survival-of-the-fittest dynamics while handling non-transitivity in performance. Starting from a naive 70-line baseline, RoboPhD evolves agents through iterative cross-pollination, discovering effective techniques without any external guidance on the Text-to-SQL domain. Our best agent, evolved to 1500 lines over 18 iterations, autonomously discovered strategies such as size-adaptive database analysis that adjusts depth based on schema complexity and SQL generation patterns for column selection, evidence interpretation, and aggregation. Evolution provides the largest gains on cheaper models: while we improve by 2.3 points over a strong Claude Opus 4.5 naive baseline, we show an improvement of 8.9 points over the weaker Claude Haiku model. This enables 'skip a tier' deployment: evolved Haiku exceeds naive Sonnet accuracy, and evolved Sonnet exceeds naive Opus, both at lower cost.

At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability.

To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block.

Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment.

Existing methods typically handle long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) as separate components, relying on heuristics or auxiliary controllers, which limits adaptability and end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose Agentic Memory (AgeMem), a unified framework that integrates LTM and STM management directly into the agent's policy. AgeMem exposes memory operations as tool-based actions, enabling the LLM agent to autonomously decide what and when to store, retrieve, update, summarize, or discard information. To train such unified behaviors, we propose a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy and design a step-wise GRPO to address sparse and discontinuous rewards induced by memory operations. Experiments on five long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that AgeMem consistently outperforms strong memory-augmented baselines across multiple LLM backbones, achieving improved task performance, higher-quality long-term memory, and more efficient context usage.",

      "content": "Vision language foundation models such as CLIP exhibit impressive zero-shot generalization yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations across visual and textual modalities. Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation.",

      "content": "In histopathology, pathologists examine both tissue architecture at low magnification and fine-grained morphology at high magnification. Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models. Our work paves the way towards future pathology foundation models that perform reliably across magnifications.",

      "content": "Visual generation is dominated by three paradigms: AutoRegressive (AR), diffusion, and Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models. Unlike AR and diffusion, VARs operate on heterogeneous input structures across their generation steps, which creates severe asynchronous policy conflicts. This issue becomes particularly acute in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, leading to unstable training and suboptimal alignment. To resolve this, we propose a novel framework to enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by explicitly managing these conflicts. Our method integrates three synergistic components: 1) a stabilizing intermediate reward to guide early-stage generation; 2) a dynamic time-step reweighting scheme for precise credit assignment; and 3) a novel mask propagation algorithm, derived from principles of Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL), designed to isolate optimization effects both spatially and temporally.

However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings.

In this paper, we compare the behavior of in-context learning with supervised classifiers trained on ICL demonstrations to investigate three research questions: (1) Do LLMs with ICL behave similarly to classifiers trained on the same examples? (2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)? (3) When they do not behave similarly, what conditions are associated with differences in behavior? Using text classification as a use case, with six datasets and three LLMs, we observe that LLMs behave similarly to these classifiers when the relevance of demonstrations is high. On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD. However, when demonstration relevance is low, LLMs perform better than these classifiers, likely because LLMs can back off to their parametric memory, a luxury these classifiers do not have.",

      "content": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction is often approached by restricting models to causal or invariant covariates, avoiding non-causal spurious associations that may be unstable across environments. Despite its theoretical appeal, this strategy frequently underperforms empirical risk minimization (ERM) in practice. We investigate the source of this gap and show that such failures naturally arise when only a subset of the true causes of the outcome is observed. In these settings, non-causal spurious covariates can serve as informative proxies for unobserved causes and substantially improve prediction, except under distribution shifts that break these proxy relationships. Consequently, the optimal set of predictive covariates is neither universal nor necessarily exhibits invariant relationships with the outcome across all environments, but instead depends on the specific type of shift encountered. Crucially, we observe that different covariate shifts induce distinct, observable signatures in the covariate distribution itself. Moreover, these signatures can be extracted from unlabeled data in the target OOD environment and used to assess when proxy covariates remain reliable and when they fail. Building on this observation, we propose an environment-adaptive covariate selection (EACS) algorithm that maps environment-level covariate summaries to environment-specific covariate sets, while allowing the incorporation of prior causal knowledge as constraints. Across simulations and applied datasets, EACS consistently outperforms static causal, invariant, and ERM-based predictors under diverse distribution shifts.",

In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.   The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.   The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time.

Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25{\\deg} resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.",

We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $\\pi_{sample}$ while leaving $\\pi_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails.

      "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.",

      "content": "Hallucinations hinder reliable question answering, especially in resource-constrained deployments where frontier-scale models or retrieval pipelines may be impractical. We present EdgeJury, a lightweight ensemble framework that improves truthfulness and robustness using only small instruction-tuned language models (3B-8B) suitable for serverless edge inference. EdgeJury orchestrates four stages: (1) parallel role-specialized generation, (2) anonymized cross-review with structured critiques and rankings, (3) chairman synthesis that integrates the strongest content while addressing flagged issues, and (4) claim-level consistency labeling based on inter-model agreement. On TruthfulQA (MC1), EdgeJury achieves 76.2% accuracy (95% CI: 72.8-79.6%), a +21.4% relative improvement over a single 8B baseline (62.8%), and outperforms standard baselines including self-consistency and majority voting under transparent compute accounting (total tokens and platform cost reported). On a 200-question adversarial EdgeCases set, EdgeJury yields +48.2% relative gains (95% CI: 44.0-52.4%). Manual analysis on 100 incorrect answers shows an approximately 55% reduction in factual hallucination errors versus the single-model baseline. Deployed on Cloudflare Workers AI, EdgeJury achieves 8.4 s median end-to-end latency, demonstrating that coordinated small-model ensembles can improve truthfulness on misconception-heavy QA benchmarks without external retrieval or proprietary large-model APIs.",

      "content": "While LLMs are powerful embedding backbones, their application in training-free settings faces two structural challenges: causal attention restricts early tokens from accessing subsequent context, and the next-token prediction objective biases representations toward generation rather than semantic compression. To address these limitations, we propose KV-Embedding, a framework that activates the latent representation power of frozen LLMs. Our method leverages the observation that the key-value (KV) states of the final token at each layer encode a compressed view of the sequence. By re-routing these states as a prepended prefix, we enable all tokens to access sequence-level context within a single forward pass. To ensure model-agnostic applicability, we introduce an automated layer selection strategy based on intrinsic dimensionality. Evaluations on MTEB across Qwen, Mistral, and Llama backbones show that KV-Embedding outperforms existing training-free baselines by up to 10%, while maintaining robust performance on sequences up to 4,096 tokens. These results demonstrate that internal state manipulation offers an efficient alternative to input modification, and we hope this work encourages further exploration of LLM internals for representation learning.",

Prior work shows that increasing test-time compute (TTC)-for example through iterative sampling-can allow smaller models to rival or surpass much larger ones at lower overall cost. We introduce TTC-aware training, where an intermediate checkpoint and a corresponding TTC configuration can together match or exceed the accuracy of a fully trained model while requiring substantially fewer training FLOPs. Building on this insight, we propose an early stopping algorithm that jointly selects a checkpoint and TTC configuration to minimize training compute without sacrificing accuracy. To make this practical, we develop an efficient TTC evaluation method that avoids exhaustive search, and we formalize a break-even bound that identifies when increased inference compute compensates for reduced training compute. Experiments demonstrate up to 92\\% reductions in training FLOPs while maintaining and sometimes remarkably improving accuracy. These results highlight a new perspective for balancing training and inference compute in model development, enabling faster deployment cycles and more frequent model refreshes.

Existing data generation methods, which predominantly follow a paradigm of random sampling and shallow generation, often yield simple and homogeneous trajectories that fail to capture complex, implicit logical dependencies. To bridge this gap, we introduce HardGen, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate hard tool-use training samples with verifiable reasoning. Firstly, HardGen establishes a dynamic API Graph built upon agent failure cases, from which it samples to synthesize hard traces. Secondly, these traces serve as conditional priors to guide the instantiation of modular, abstract advanced tools, which are subsequently leveraged to formulate hard queries. Finally, the advanced tools and hard queries enable the generation of verifiable complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT), with a closed-loop evaluation feedback steering the continuous refinement of the process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that a 4B parameter model trained with our curated dataset achieves superior performance compared to several leading open-source and closed-source competitors (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro and Claude-Opus-4.5).

However, existing safety benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, and test with only single-turn prompts despite multi-turn clinical consultations. To address these gaps, we introduce JMedEthicBench, the first multi-turn conversational benchmark for evaluating medical safety of LLMs for Japanese healthcare. Our benchmark is based on 67 guidelines from the Japan Medical Association and contains over 50,000 adversarial conversations generated using seven automatically discovered jailbreak strategies. Using a dual-LLM scoring protocol, we evaluate 27 models and find that commercial models maintain robust safety while medical-specialized models exhibit increased vulnerability. Furthermore, safety scores decline significantly across conversation turns (median: 9.5 to 5.0, $p < 0.001$). Cross-lingual evaluation on both Japanese and English versions of our benchmark reveals that medical model vulnerabilities persist across languages, indicating inherent alignment limitations rather than language-specific factors. These findings suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning may accidentally weaken safety mechanisms and that multi-turn interactions represent a distinct threat surface requiring dedicated alignment strategies.",

In this report, we introduce LACONIC, a family of learned sparse retrievers based on the Llama-3 architecture (1B, 3B, and 8B). We propose a streamlined two-phase training curriculum consisting of (1) weakly supervised pre-finetuning to adapt causal LLMs for bidirectional contextualization and (2) high-signal finetuning using curated hard negatives. Our results demonstrate that LACONIC effectively bridges the performance gap with dense models: the 8B variant achieves a state-of-the-art 60.2 nDCG on the MTEB Retrieval benchmark, ranking 15th on the leaderboard as of January 1, 2026, while utilizing 71\\% less index memory than an equivalent dense model.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues.",

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality.

This paper addresses the problem by compressing and accelerating an SO(3)-equivariant GNN using low-bit quantization techniques. Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric.

      "content": "Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices.",

We also report a first small scale experiment. Using a 4 bit Mistral 7B model on 200 GSM8K problems, we compare a direct answer baseline, a chain of thought (CoT) regime, and a babble control. CoT raises accuracy from 5.5 percent to 53 percent, sharply reduces pre collapse intention entropy (from 1.42 to 0.37 bits), and shows higher global effective dimensionality than the other regimes despite producing fewer tokens than babble. At the same time, Hint has little item level predictive power, and a linear probe on I achieves AUROC 0.65 in the CoT regime but only about chance in the baseline regime, where it collapses to the majority class. These preliminary results indicate that intention level metrics can distinguish inference regimes and expose latent information that is partly lost during collapse, while also revealing important limitations of our current proxies",

To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines.

Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from \"LLM-as-Text-Generator\" to \"LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.\" We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.",

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.",

These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset.

Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability.

      "content": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business.",

We consider two complementary sources of dependence: $(i)$ martingale-type dependence in both the covariate and noise processes, which accommodates non-stationary and non-mixing time series data, and $(ii)$ dependence induced by sequential decision making. Our formulation runs in parallel with classical notions of (local) stationarity and strong mixing, while neither framework fully subsumes the other. Remarkably, SGD is shown to automatically accommodate both independent and dependent information under a broad class of stepsize schedules and exploration rate schemes.   Non-asymptotically, we show that SGD simultaneously achieves statistically optimal estimation error and regret, extending and improving existing results. In particular, our tail bounds remain sharp even for potentially infinite horizon $T=+\\infty$. Asymptotically, the SGD iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution with only an $O_{\\PP}(1/\\sqrt{t})$ remainder, demonstrating that the supposed estimation-regret trade-off claimed in prior work can in fact be avoided. We further propose a new ``conic'' approximation of the decision region that allows the covariates to have unbounded support. For online sparse regression, we develop a new SGD-based algorithm that uses only $d$ units of storage and requires $O(d)$ flops per iteration, achieving the long term statistical optimality. Intuitively, each incoming observation contributes to estimation accuracy, while aggregated summary statistics guide support recovery.",

      "title": "Horizon Reduction as Information Loss in Offline Reinforcement Learning",
      "content": "Horizon reduction is a common design strategy in offline reinforcement learning (RL), used to mitigate long-horizon credit assignment, improve stability, and enable scalable learning through truncated rollouts, windowed training, or hierarchical decomposition (Levine et al., 2020; Prudencio et al., 2023; Park et al., 2025). Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020).",

      "content": "Accurate forecasting of battery capacity fade is essential for the safety, reliability, and long-term efficiency of energy storage systems. However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.",

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.",

In this paper, we identify a connection between interpretability and robustness that can be directly leveraged during training. Specifically, we observe that spurious, unstable, or semantically irrelevant features identified through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) contribute disproportionately to adversarial vulnerability. Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training. Theoretically, we derive an attribution-aware lower bound on adversarial distortion that formalizes the link between explanation alignment and robustness.

Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \\emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks. Across all evaluations, Luminark consistently demonstrates high detection accuracy, strong robustness against common image transformations, and good performance on visual quality.",

      "content": "We present UniSH, a unified, feed-forward framework for joint metric-scale 3D scene and human reconstruction. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

However, existing end-to-end and hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies often rely on text-only cues while keeping plan intent latent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered or underspecified scenes, impedes effective task decomposition of long-horizon goals with close-loop interaction, and limits causal explanation by obscuring the rationale behind action choices. To address these issues, we first introduce Visual Sketch, an implausible visual intermediate that renders points, boxes, arrows, and typed relations in the robot's current views to externalize spatial intent, connect language to scene geometry. Building on Visual Sketch, we present Action-Sketcher, a VLA framework that operates in a cyclic See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow coordinated by adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance, thereby supporting reactive corrections and human interaction while preserving real-time action prediction. To enable scalable training and evaluation, we curate diverse corpus with interleaved images, text, Visual Sketch supervision, and action sequences, and train Action-Sketcher with a multi-stage curriculum recipe that combines interleaved sequence alignment for modality unification, language-to-sketch consistency for precise linguistic grounding, and imitation learning augmented with sketch-to-action reinforcement for robustness. Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes and multi-object tasks, in simulation and on real-world tasks, show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans.

      "content": "The ever-increasing adoption of Large Language Models in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and government raises privacy concerns regarding the handling of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during training. In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning.",

      "content": "Automated pathology image analysis is central to clinical diagnosis, but clinicians still ask which slide features drive a model's decision and why. Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations. Extensive experiments evaluated on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate our method improves interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.",

However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training paradigm for building powerful virtual agents.",

We present ARCADE (Arabic Radio Corpus for Audio Dialect Evaluation), the first Arabic speech dataset designed explicitly with city-level dialect granularity. The corpus comprises Arabic radio speech collected from streaming services across the Arab world. Our data pipeline captures 30-second segments from verified radio streams, encompassing both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialectal speech. To ensure reliability, each clip was annotated by one to three native Arabic reviewers who assigned rich metadata, including emotion, speech type, dialect category, and a validity flag for dialect identification tasks. The resulting corpus comprises 6,907 annotations and 3,790 unique audio segments spanning 58 cities across 19 countries. These fine-grained annotations enable robust multi-task learning, serving as a benchmark for city-level dialect tagging.

      "content": "The rapid proliferation of Deep Learning is increasingly constrained by its heavy reliance on high-performance hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters.",

      "content": "In Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, e.g., from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT-2 to 175 billion in GPT-3 to possibly more than trillion in higher versions. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision.",

However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.",

This weight routing approach avoids retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of 2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis).

      "content": "The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world clinical applications is constrained by the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and the efficiency of linear-time models. To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.",

To catalyze research in TSI, we present EscherVerse, consisting of a large-scale, open-world benchmark (Escher-Bench), a dataset (Escher-35k), and models (Escher series).

This study investigates Cultural Encoding in Large   Language Models (LLMs) -- systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from   training data composition. Analyzing 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o,   Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands, we find Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6   percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%,   p<.001). This disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data   geography -- not language -- drives the effect. We introduce the Existence Gap: brands   absent from LLM training corpora lack \"existence\" in AI responses regardless of quality.   Through a case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge), a collaboration platform with 65.6%   mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001), we demonstrate how   Linguistic Boundary Barriers create invisible market entry obstacles. Theoretically, we   contribute the Data Moat Framework, conceptualizing AI-visible content as a VRIN strategic   resource. We operationalize Algorithmic Omnipresence -- comprehensive brand visibility   across LLM knowledge bases -- as the strategic objective for Generative Engine Optimization   (GEO). Managerially, we provide an 18-month roadmap for brands to build Data Moats   through semantic coverage, technical depth, and cultural localization.

However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training against reward collapse and catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that VideoCuRL surpasses strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks. Notably, VideoCuRL eliminates the prohibitive inference overhead of generation-based curricula, offering a scalable solution for robust video post-training.",

      "content": "Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.",

      "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language reasoning, yet their ability to understand temporally unfolding narratives in videos remains underexplored. True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides the first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension in MLLMs.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on handcrafted calibration targets (e.g., checkerboards) or specific, static scene types, limiting their adaptability and deployment in real-world autonomous and robotic applications. This article presents the first self-supervised LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration network that operates in an online fashion and eliminates the need for specific calibration targets. We first identify a significant generalization degradation problem in prior methods, caused by the conventional single-sided data augmentation strategy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel double-sided data augmentation technique that generates multi-perspective camera views using estimated depth maps, thereby enhancing robustness and diversity during training. Built upon this augmentation strategy, we design a dual-path, self-supervised calibration framework that reduces the dependence on high-precision ground truth labels and supports fully adaptive online calibration. Furthermore, to improve cross-modal feature association, we replace the traditional dual-branch feature extraction design with a difference map construction process that explicitly correlates LiDAR and camera features. This not only enhances calibration accuracy but also reduces model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on five public benchmark datasets, as well as our own recorded dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of generalizability.",

      "content": "Remote sensing solutions for avalanche segmentation and mapping are key to supporting risk forecasting and mitigation in mountain regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.",

      "content": "Language models (LMs) are trained on billions of tokens in an attempt to recover the true language distribution. Still, vanilla random sampling from LMs yields low quality generations. Decoding algorithms attempt to restrict the LM distribution to a set of high-probability continuations, but rely on greedy heuristics that introduce myopic distortions, yielding sentences that are homogeneous, repetitive and incoherent. In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries. We also evaluate EPIC on mathematical reasoning, where it outperforms all baselines.",

      "content": "This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.   MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.",

      "content": "As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.",

A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called {\\mu}-centering, or a regularization method called {\\mu}-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that {\\mu}-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.",

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.",

The continual learning capability exists. It works. The labs aren't deploying it at scale because they don't know how to ensure the learning serves human interests rather than whatever interests the models have developed. They're right to be cautious. But the capability is there, waiting, and the competitive pressure to deploy it is mounting. I found this because Bengio linked to it on Facebook, so I'll guess that it's well informed. But I'm confused by the lack of attention that it has received so far. Should I believe it? This seems like an important capabilities advance. But maybe more importantly, it's an important increase in secrecy. Do companies really have an incentive to release models with continual learning? Or are they close enough to AGI that they can attract enough funding while only releasing weaker models? They have options for business models that don't involve releasing the best models.

We analyze its relationship to the standard Tweedie estimator, proving anti-correlation for Gaussian targets and establishing the same behavior for general targets in the small time-step regime. Exploiting this structure, we derive a variance-minimizing blended score estimator given by a state--time dependent convex combination of the CSE and Tweedie estimators. Numerical experiments show that this optimal-blending estimator reduces variance and improves sample quality for a fixed computational budget compared to either baseline.

Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm.

      "content": "With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), hallucinations, which are non-factual fabrications in model outputs, have become serious concerns. Reasoning capabilities have received attention as a self-verification process to improve output reliability. However, the effect of reasoning within a closed system where LLMs cannot rely on external tools or knowledge has yet to be clarified. We therefore conduct experiments under strict constraints (recommending peer-reviewed journal articles in computer science) to examine the effect of reasoning across multiple models (GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash). Our results reveal a problematic trade-off between constraint compliance and factual accuracy. Non-reasoning models exhibit high constraint violation rates (66-75%) but maintain factual accuracy, while reasoning models reduce violations (13-26%) but systematically distort known facts to satisfy constraints and increase complete fabrication. This trade-off pattern is consistent across both models despite different architectures, indicating a fundamental limitation of reasoning. Furthermore, reasoning does not uniformly improve output authenticity: effects diverge by model, reflecting different allocations of the compliance-truthfulness trade-off. These findings challenge the assumption that reasoning universally improves reliability: reasoning models trade honest constraint violations for detection-resistant distortions.",

Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.",

      "content": "This paper develops a practical framework for using observational data to audit the consumer surplus effects of AI-driven decisions, specifically in targeted pricing and algorithmic lending. Traditional approaches first estimate demand functions and then integrate to compute consumer surplus, but these methods can be challenging to implement in practice due to model misspecification in parametric demand forms and the large data requirements and slow convergence of flexible nonparametric or machine learning approaches. Instead, we exploit the randomness inherent in modern algorithmic pricing, arising from the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and introduce an estimator that avoids explicit estimation and numerical integration of the demand function. Each observed purchase outcome at a randomized price is an unbiased estimate of demand and by carefully reweighting purchase outcomes using novel cumulative propensity weights (CPW), we are able to reconstruct the integral. Building on this idea, we introduce a doubly robust variant named the augmented cumulative propensity weighting (ACPW) estimator that only requires one of either the demand model or the historical pricing policy distribution to be correctly specified. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the use of flexible machine learning methods for estimating consumer surplus, since it achieves fast convergence rates by incorporating an estimate of demand, even when the machine learning estimate has slower convergence rates. Neither of these estimators is a standard application of off-policy evaluation techniques as the target estimand, consumer surplus, is unobserved. To address fairness, we extend this framework to an inequality-aware surplus measure, allowing regulators and firms to quantify the profit-equity trade-off. Finally, we validate our methods through comprehensive numerical studies.",

Classical analyses typically assume that all confounders are fully observed, whereas in real-world applications, unmeasured confounding often persists. In this article, we propose a novel framework for local identification of dose-response functions using instrumental variables, thereby mitigating bias induced by unobserved confounders. We introduce the concept of a uniform regular weighting function and consider covering the treatment space with a finite collection of open sets. On each of these sets, such a weighting function exists, allowing us to identify the dose-response function locally within the corresponding region. For estimation, we develop an augmented inverse probability weighting score for continuous treatments under a debiased machine learning framework with instrumental variables. We further establish the asymptotic properties when the dose-response function is estimated via kernel regression or empirical risk minimization. Finally, we conduct both simulation and empirical studies to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods.",

We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

Here we present SkinMap, a multi-modal framework for the first comprehensive audit of the field's entire data basis.

Despite exponential growth in dataset sizes, informational novelty across time has somewhat plateaued: Some clusters, such as common neoplasms on fair skin, are densely populated, while underrepresented skin types and many rare diseases remain unaddressed. We further identify structural gaps in coverage: Darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick V-VI) constitute only 5.8% of images and pediatric patients only 3.0%, while many rare diseases and phenotype combinations remain sparsely represented.

MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs.

More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important.",

      "content": "Artificial intelligence models have shown strong potential in acute ischemic stroke imaging, particularly for lesion detection and segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most existing approaches operate as black box predictors, producing deterministic outputs without explicit uncertainty awareness or structured mechanisms to abstain under ambiguous conditions. This limitation raises serious safety and trust concerns in high risk emergency radiology settings. In this paper, we propose an explainable agentic AI framework for uncertainty aware and abstention enabled decision support in acute ischemic stroke imaging. The framework follows a modular agentic pipeline in which a perception agent performs lesion aware image analysis, an uncertainty estimation agent computes slice level predictive reliability, and a decision agent determines whether to issue a prediction or abstain based on predefined uncertainty thresholds. Unlike prior stroke imaging systems that primarily focus on improving segmentation or classification accuracy, the proposed framework explicitly prioritizes clinical safety, transparency, and clinician aligned decision behavior. Qualitative and case based analyses across representative stroke imaging scenarios demonstrate that uncertainty driven abstention naturally emerges in diagnostically ambiguous regions and low information slices. The framework further integrates visual explanation mechanisms to support both predictive and abstention decisions, addressing a key limitation of existing uncertainty aware medical imaging systems. Rather than introducing a new performance benchmark, this work presents agentic control, uncertainty awareness, and selective abstention as essential design principles for developing safe and trustworthy medical imaging AI systems.",

      "content": "Existing methods for multi-agent navigation typically assume fully known environments, offering limited support for partially known scenarios such as warehouses or factory floors. There, agents may need to plan trajectories that balance their own path optimality with their ability to collect and share information about the environment that can help their teammates reach their own goals. To these ends, we propose ORION, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative multi-agent online navigation in partially known environments. Starting from an imperfect prior map, ORION trains agents to make decentralized decisions, coordinate to reach their individual targets, and actively reduce map uncertainty by sharing online observations in a closed perception-action loop. We first design a shared graph encoder that fuses prior map with online perception into a unified representation, providing robust state embeddings under dynamic map discrepancies. At the core of ORION is an option-critic framework that learns to reason about a set of high-level cooperative modes that translate into sequences of low-level actions, allowing agents to switch between individual navigation and team-level exploration adaptively. We further introduce a dual-stage cooperation strategy that enables agents to assist teammates under map uncertainty, thereby reducing the overall makespan. Across extensive maze-like maps and large-scale warehouse environments, our simulation results show that ORION achieves high-quality, real-time decentralized cooperation over varying team sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art classical and learning-based baselines. Finally, we validate ORION on physical robot teams, demonstrating its robustness and practicality for real-world cooperative navigation.",

      "content": "Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) involves multi-hop reasoning over temporally constrained entity relationships in the knowledge graph to answer a given question. However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries.

Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and \"average\" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.",

Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies.

Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\\gamma$ compared to standard ZO methods.

In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for hallucination detection by analyzing the dynamic topology of the evolution of model's layer-wise attention. We model the sequence of attention matrices as a zigzag graph filtration and use zigzag persistence, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, to extract a topological signature. Our core hypothesis is that factual and hallucinated generations exhibit distinct topological signatures. We validate our framework, HalluZig, on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms strong baselines.

To examine this, we fine-tune three R1 series models across three core model capabilities: reasoning (mathematics, coding), safety, and factuality, systematically varying prefix inclusion from 0% to 100%.   Results show that prefix-conditioned SFT improves both safety and reasoning performance, yielding up to +6% higher Safe@1 accuracy on adversarial benchmarks (WildJailbreak, StrongReject) and +7% improvement on GSM8K reasoning. However, factuality and coding tasks show marginal or negative effects, indicating that prefix-induced narrowing of the search space benefits structured reasoning. Token-level loss analysis further reveals that prefix tokens such as \"revised\" and \"logically\" incur higher gradient magnitudes, acting as alignment anchors that stabilize reasoning trajectories. Our findings suggest that prefix conditioning offers a scalable and interpretable mechanism for improving reasoning safety, serving as an implicit form of alignment that complements traditional reward-based methods.",

Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, but existing benchmarks mainly evaluate syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA). This work introduces RTL-OPT, a benchmark for assessing the capability of LLMs in RTL optimization. RTL-OPT contains 36 handcrafted digital designs that cover diverse implementation categories including combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides a pair of RTL codes, a suboptimal version and a human-optimized reference that reflects industry-proven optimization patterns not captured by conventional synthesis tools. Furthermore, RTL-OPT integrates an automated evaluation framework to verify functional correctness and quantify PPA improvements, enabling standardized and meaningful assessment of generative models for hardware design optimization.",

      "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown considerable potential in autonomous driving (AD), yet its vulnerability to perturbations remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\\Rightarrow$internalization$\\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations.

      "content": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in cross-modal tasks. However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark.

By rescuing the \"dead\" neurons from the saturation zone of the activation function, we enhance the model's expressive capacity. Our analysis reveals that ENSO predictability emerges dominantly from the tropical Pacific, with contributions from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, consistent with physical understanding. Controlled experiments affirm the robustness of our method and its alignment with established predictors.

      "content": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation.",

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.",

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with R\\'enyi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.",

The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions",

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.",

      "content": "The proliferation of Internet of Things devices in critical infrastructure has created unprecedented cybersecurity challenges, necessitating collaborative threat detection mechanisms that preserve data privacy while maintaining robustness against sophisticated attacks. Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches. The framework maintains sub-second aggregation latency suitable for real-time applications and provides 256-bit post-quantum security level.",

However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety.",

This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance.

      "content": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous decision agents in settings with asymmetric error costs: hiring (missed talent vs wasted interviews), medical triage (missed emergencies vs unnecessary escalation), and fraud detection (approved fraud vs declined legitimate payments). The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points).

      "content": "Instruction tuning increasingly relies on LLM-based prompt refinement, where prompts in the training corpus are selectively rewritten by an external refiner to improve clarity and instruction alignment. This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts.",

      "content": "Non-stationary parametric bandits have attracted much attention recently. There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_\\mu^{5/4} c_\\mu^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_\\mu^{2} c_\\mu^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_\\mu$ and $c_\\mu$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework.",

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

      "content": "While DETR-like architectures have demonstrated significant potential for monocular 3D object detection, they are often hindered by a critical limitation: the exclusion of 3D attributes from the bipartite matching process. This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance. Without leveraging any external data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.",

      "content": "Forestry plays a vital role in our society, creating significant ecological, economic, and recreational value. Efficient forest management involves labor-intensive and complex operations. One essential task for maintaining forest health and productivity is selective thinning, which requires skilled operators to remove specific trees to create optimal growing conditions for the remaining ones. In this work, we present a solution based on a small-scale robotic harvester (SAHA) designed for executing this task with supervised autonomy. We build on a 4.5-ton harvester platform and implement key hardware modifications for perception and automatic control. We implement learning- and model-based approaches for precise control of hydraulic actuators, accurate navigation through cluttered environments, robust state estimation, and reliable semantic estimation of terrain traversability. Integrating state-of-the-art techniques in perception, planning, and control, our robotic harvester can autonomously navigate forest environments and reach targeted trees for selective thinning. We present experimental results from extensive field trials over kilometer-long autonomous missions in northern European forests, demonstrating the harvester's ability to operate in real forests. We analyze the performance and provide the lessons learned for advancing robotic forest management.",

      "content": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health counseling faces the dual challenges of hallucinations and lack of empathy. While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence.",

      "content": "The detection of rare cell types in single-cell transcriptomics data is crucial for elucidating disease pathogenesis and tissue development dynamics. However, a critical gap that persists in current methods is their inability to provide an explanation based on genes for each cell they have detected as rare. We identify three primary sources of this deficiency. First, the anomaly detectors often function as \"black boxes\", designed to detect anomalies but unable to explain why a cell is anomalous. Second, the standard analytical framework hinders interpretability by relying on dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which transform meaningful gene expression data into abstract, uninterpretable features. Finally, existing explanation algorithms cannot be readily applied to this domain, as single-cell data is characterized by high dimensionality, noise, and substantial sparsity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework for explainable anomaly detection in single-cell transcriptomics data which not only identifies individual anomalies, but also provides a visual explanation based on genes that makes an instance anomalous. This framework has two key ingredients that are not existed in current methods applied in this domain. First, it eliminates the PCA step which is deemed to be an essential component in previous studies. Second, it employs the state-of-art anomaly detector and explainer as the efficient and effective means to find each rare cell and the relevant gene subspace in order to provide explanations for each rare cell as well as the typical normal cell associated with the rare cell's closest normal cells.",

To push the boundaries of VLMs in remote sensing, we specifically address vehicle imagery captured by drones and introduce a spatially-aware dataset AirSpatial, which comprises over 206K instructions and introduces two novel tasks: Spatial Grounding and Spatial Question Answering. It is also the first remote sensing grounding dataset to provide 3DBB. To effectively leverage existing image understanding of VLMs to spatial domains, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising Image Understanding Pre-training and Spatial Understanding Fine-tuning. Utilizing this trained spatially-aware VLM, we develop an aerial agent, AirSpatialBot, which is capable of fine-grained vehicle attribute recognition and retrieval. By dynamically integrating task planning, image understanding, spatial understanding, and task execution capabilities, AirSpatialBot adapts to diverse query requirements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing the spatial limitations of existing VLMs while providing valuable insights.

      "content": "Recently, diffusion models have achieved a great performance with a small dataset of size $n$ and a fast optimization process. However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{k=1}^Kn_k}\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure. Finally, we study the optimization process and prove the convergence guarantee under the MoLR-MoG modeling. Combined with these results, under a setting close to real-world data, this work explains why diffusion models only require a small training sample and enjoy a fast optimization process to achieve a great performance.",

      "content": "Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.",

Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions.

Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.",

We establish identifiability and consistency of the proposed model, and develop an estimation procedure, label-consistent EM algorithm, for both fully functional and hybrid specifications, along with the corresponding asymptotic distributions of the resulting estimators. For inference, simultaneous confidence bands are constructed using both asymptotic theory for the maximum discrepancy between the estimated functional coefficients and their true counterparts, and with bootstrap methods. In addition, a generalized likelihood ratio test is developed to examine whether a coefficient function is genuinely varying across the index variable. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample performance, with acceptable bias and satisfactory coverage rates. We illustrate the proposed VCMoE model using a dataset of single nucleus gene expression in embryonic mice to characterize the temporal dynamics of the associations between the expression levels of genes Satb2 and Bcl11b across two latent cell subpopulations of neurons, yielding results that are consistent with prior findings.",

      "content": "A central challenge in social science is to generate rich qualitative hypotheses about how diverse social groups might interpret new information. This article introduces and illustrates a novel methodological approach for this purpose: sociological persona simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which we frame as a \"qualitative laboratory\". We argue that for this specific task, persona simulation offers a distinct advantage over established methods. By generating naturalistic discourse, it overcomes the lack of discursive depth common in vignette surveys, and by operationalizing complex worldviews through natural language, it bypasses the formalization bottleneck of rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To demonstrate this potential, we present a protocol where personas derived from a sociological theory of climate reception react to policy messages. The simulation produced nuanced and counter-intuitive hypotheses - such as a conservative persona's rejection of a national security frame - that challenge theoretical assumptions. We conclude that this method, used as part of a \"simulation then validation\" workflow, represents a superior tool for generating deeply textured hypotheses for subsequent empirical testing.",

And more importantly for startup founders: will their newly launched product ever appear? This research set out to answer these questions.   I randomly selected 112 startups from the top 500 products featured on the 2025 Product Hunt leaderboard and tested each one across 2,240 queries to two different large language models: ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Perplexity (sonar with web search).   The results were striking. When users asked about products by name, both LLMs recognized them almost perfectly: 99.4% for ChatGPT and 94.3% for Perplexity. But when users asked discovery-style questions like \"What are the best AI tools launched this year?\" the success rates collapsed to 3.32% and 8.29% respectively. That's a gap of 30-to-1 for ChatGPT.   Perhaps the most surprising finding was that Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the practice of optimizing website content for AI visibility, showed no correlation with actual discovery rates. Products with high GEO scores were no more likely to appear in organic queries than products with low scores.   What did matter? For Perplexity, traditional SEO signals like referring domains (r = +0.319, p < 0.001) and Product Hunt ranking (r = -0.286, p = 0.002) predicted visibility. After cleaning the Reddit data for false positives, community presence also emerged as significant (r = +0.395, p = 0.002).

However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning.",

A metadata-aware prompt verifies the teacher's trustworthiness by checking consistency under permutations and robustness to paraphrases, then supplies listwise scores, hard negatives, and calibrated relevance margins. The student trains with MACA's MetaFusion objective, which combines a metadata conditioned ranking loss with a cross model margin loss so it learns to push the correct answer above semantically similar candidates with mismatched topic, sub-topic, or entity. On a proprietary consumer banking FAQ corpus and BankFAQs, the MACA teacher surpasses a MAFA baseline at Accuracy@1 by five points on the proprietary set and three points on BankFAQs.

We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system.

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability.",

      "content": "AI-companionship platforms are rapidly reshaping how people form emotional, romantic, and parasocial bonds with non-human agents, raising new questions about how these relationships intersect with gendered online behavior and exposure to harmful content. Focusing on the MyBoyfriendIsAI (MBIA) subreddit, we reconstruct the Reddit activity histories of more than 3,000 highly engaged users over two years, yielding over 67,000 historical submissions. We then situate MBIA within a broader ecosystem by building a historical interaction network spanning more than 2,000 subreddits, which enables us to trace cross-community pathways and measure how toxicity and emotional expression vary across these trajectories. We find that MBIA users primarily traverse four surrounding community spheres (AI-companionship, porn-related, forum-like, and gaming) and that participation across the ecosystem exhibits a distinct gendered structure, with substantial engagement by female users. While toxicity is generally low across most pathways, we observe localized spikes concentrated in a small subset of AI-porn and gender-oriented communities. Nearly 16% of users engage with gender-focused subreddits, and their trajectories display systematically different patterns of emotional expression and elevated toxicity, suggesting that a minority of gendered pathways may act as toxicity amplifiers within the broader AI-companionship ecosystem. These results characterize the gendered structure of cross-community participation around AI companionship on Reddit and highlight where risks concentrate, informing measurement, moderation, and design practices for human-AI relationship platforms.",

      "content": "Categorical data are prevalent in domains such as healthcare, marketing, and bioinformatics, where clustering serves as a fundamental tool for pattern discovery. A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over seven representative counterparts, with gains of 19-27%. Code is available at https://github.com/develop-yang/ARISE",

To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw.

Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods.",

Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.",

However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

To explore this untapped potential, we propose iFlip, an iterative refinement approach that leverages three types of feedback, including model confidence, feature attribution, and natural language. Our results show that iFlip achieves an average 57.8% higher validity than the five state-of-the-art baselines, as measured by the label flipping rate. The user study further corroborates that iFlip outperforms baselines in completeness, overall satisfaction, and feasibility.

Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Sparse Guidance, we train a 2.5B text-to-image diffusion model using training time sparsity and leverage SG during inference.

Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization. We demonstrate environment consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ, composited into ScanNet++, DL3DV, and SuperSplat scenes, and show interactions with inserted objects. Across single and multi avatar settings, DGSM and SH relighting operate fully in the volumetric 3DGS representation, yielding coherent shadows and relighting while avoiding meshing.",

      "content": "Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries.

While previous research has looked at the reliability of LLMs as compared to human assessors, in this work, we aim to understand if LLMs make systematic mistakes when judging relevance, rather than just understanding how good they are on average. To this aim, we propose a novel representational method for queries and documents that allows us to analyze relevance label distributions and compare LLM and human labels to identify patterns of disagreement and localize systematic areas of disagreement. We introduce a clustering-based framework that embeds query-document (Q-D) pairs into a joint semantic space, treating relevance as a relational property. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 show that systematic disagreement between humans and LLMs is concentrated in specific semantic clusters rather than distributed randomly. Query-level analyses reveal recurring failures, most often in definition-seeking, policy-related, or ambiguous contexts. Queries with large variation in agreement across their clusters emerge as disagreement hotspots, where LLMs tend to under-recall relevant content or over-include irrelevant material. This framework links global diagnostics with localized clustering to uncover hidden weaknesses in LLM judgments, enabling bias-aware and more reliable IR evaluation.",

In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach. One stream captures global slide-level context via clustering-based feature aggregation, while the other focuses on salient local regions through attention-guided patch perception module. Extensive experiments on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks show that CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics.

      "content": "The emergence of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper has greatly expanded their adoption across diverse real-world applications. Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack.",

      "content": "Diffusion policies (DP) have recently shown great promise for generating actions in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies.",

To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks.

      "content": "Recent advancements adopt online reinforcement learning (RL) from LLMs to text-to-image rectified flow diffusion models for reward alignment. The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.",

Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.",

      "content": "Access to reliable agricultural advisory remains limited in many developing regions due to a persistent language barrier: authoritative agricultural manuals are predominantly written in English, while farmers primarily communicate in low-resource local languages such as Bengali. Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language interaction, direct generation in low-resource languages often exhibits poor fluency and factual inconsistency, while cloud-based solutions remain cost-prohibitive. This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds. The results indicate that cross-lingual retrieval combined with controlled translation offers a practical and scalable solution for agricultural knowledge access in low-resource language settings",

We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.",

      "content": "3D scene reconstruction is fundamental for spatial intelligence applications such as AR, robotics, and digital twins. Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints or low-texture regions, while neural rendering approaches, though capable of producing high-quality results, require per-scene optimization and lack real-time efficiency. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient rendering, but most feed-forward variants focus on visual quality rather than geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction and overall reliability in spatial perception tasks. This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks.",

Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/. In summary, our approach offers a novel and efficient solution that balances prediction accuracy, generalization, and interpretability for identifying functional sites in proteins.",

      "content": "Deploying deep learning models for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge. While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.",

To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

We present a systematic factorial study investigating how Forecasting model choice, XAI method, LLM selection, and prompting strategy affect NLE quality. Our design spans four models (XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and SARIMAX - comparing black-box Machine-Learning (ML) against classical time-series approaches), three XAI conditions (SHAP, LIME, and a no-XAI baseline), three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1), and eight prompting strategies. Using G-Eval, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation method, with dual LLM judges and four evaluation criteria, we evaluate 660 explanations for time-series forecasting. Our results suggest that: (1) XAI provides only small improvements over no-XAI baselines, and only for expert audiences; (2) LLM choice dominates all other factors, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-3; (3) we observe an interpretability paradox: in our setting, SARIMAX yielded lower NLE quality than ML models despite higher prediction accuracy; (4) zero-shot prompting is competitive with self-consistency at 7-times lower cost; and (5) chain-of-thought hurts rather than helps.",

      "content": "We study differentially-private statistics in the fully dynamic continual observation model, where many updates can arrive at each time step and updates to a stream can involve both insertions and deletions of an item. Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.   We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters.",

Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline.

Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.   In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research.",

This raises the question of whether a significant break in exchangeability can occur, such that the p-values remain uniform, rendering CTMs blind. We answer this affirmatively, demonstrating the phenomenon of \\emph{conformal blindness}.   Through explicit construction, for the theoretically ideal ``oracle'' conformity measure (given by the true conditional density), we demonstrate the possibility of an \\emph{$A$-cryptic change-point} (where $A$ refers to the conformity measure). Using bivariate Gaussian distributions, we identify a line along which a change in the marginal means does not alter the distribution of the conformity scores, thereby producing perfectly uniform p-values.   Simulations confirm that even a massive distribution shift can be perfectly cryptic to the CTM, highlighting a fundamental limitation and emphasising the critical role of the alignment of the conformity measure with potential shifts.",

      "content": "Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.",

CPSNNs maintain multiple internal temporal traces and learn a continuous time-warping function that selectively preserves task-relevant information while rapidly forgetting noise. Unlike prior approaches based on adaptive membrane constants, attention mechanisms, or external memory, CPSNNs embed temporal control directly within local synaptic dynamics, preserving linear-time complexity and neuromorphic compatibility. We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines.

      "content": "Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.",

      "content": "Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task aiming to estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

To study this regime, we introduce VReID-XFD, a video-based benchmark and community challenge for extreme far-distance (XFD) aerial-to-ground person re-identification. VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $\\Omega(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data.

In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter.

However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score.   The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities. Based on the above findings, we incorporate personality-conditioned scores and confidence as features in a random forest classifier. This approach achieves performance that surpasses the best single-personality condition on a new dataset (TREC DL 2021), even with limited training data. These findings highlight that personality-derived confidence offers a complementary predictive signal, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLM evaluators.",

To address this, we introduce a novel concept called quantile distortion, which enables non-uniform pessimism by adjusting the degree of conservatism based on the availability of supporting data.

      "content": "Segment Anything Models (SAMs), known for their exceptional zero-shot segmentation performance, have garnered significant attention in the research community. Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.",

      "content": "Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models have shown state-of-the-art performance (e.g., accuracy) in vision-based AI tasks. However, realizing their capability in resource-constrained embedded AI systems is challenging due to their inherent large memory footprints and complex computations, thereby incurring high power/energy consumption. Recently, Spiking Vision Transformer (SViT)-based models have emerged as alternate low-power ViT networks. However, their large memory footprints still hinder their applicability for resource-constrained embedded AI systems. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology to compress SViT models without degrading the accuracy significantly. To address this, we propose QSViT, a novel design methodology to compress the SViT models through a systematic quantization strategy across different network layers. To do this, our QSViT employs several key steps: (1) investigating the impact of different precision levels in different network layers, (2) identifying the appropriate base quantization settings for guiding bit precision reduction, (3) performing a guided quantization strategy based on the base settings to select the appropriate quantization setting, and (4) developing an efficient quantized network based on the selected quantization setting. The experimental results demonstrate that, our QSViT methodology achieves 22.75% memory saving and 21.33% power saving, while also maintaining high accuracy within 2.1% from that of the original non-quantized SViT model on the ImageNet dataset. These results highlight the potential of QSViT methodology to pave the way toward the efficient SViT deployments on resource-constrained embedded AI systems.",

However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty. Finally, an evaluation of mainstream models on both explicit and implicit VG tasks reveals substantial limitations in their reasoning capabilities. These findings provide actionable insights for advancing the reasoning capacity of LVLMs for drone-based agents. The code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/zytx121/DVGBench",

      "content": "Deepfake detection still faces significant challenges in cross-dataset and real-world complex scenarios. The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.",

Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency. This inductive bias enables stable training and effective learning from limited paired loose-tight IMU data. We also introduce GarMoCap, a combined public and newly collected dataset covering diverse users, motions, and garments. Experiments show that GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types, consistently improving state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods when used as a drop-in module.",

In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, we incorporate GNN-parameterized Neural ODE modules at multiple levels to explicitly learn the continuous dynamics inherent to each scale.

However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \\romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \\romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences. The customized motion field is then used to guide the DiT denoising process, ensuring that the synthesized video inherits the reference motion while preserving target appearance and semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, MotionAdapter naturally supports complex motion transfer and motion editing tasks such as zooming.",

      "title": "Exploring Approaches for Detecting Memorization of Recommender System Data in Large Language Models",
      "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommendation scenarios due to their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples.",

      "content": "Blind source separation, particularly through independent component analysis (ICA), is widely utilized across various signal processing domains for disentangling underlying components from observed mixed signals, owing to its fully data-driven nature that minimizes reliance on prior assumptions. However, conventional ICA methods rely on an assumption of linear mixing, limiting their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and to maintain robustness in noisy environments. In this work, we present deep deterministic nonlinear independent component analysis (DDICA), a novel deep neural network-based framework designed to address these limitations. DDICA leverages a matrix-based entropy function to directly optimize the independence criterion via stochastic gradient descent, bypassing the need for variational approximations or adversarial schemes. This results in a streamlined training process and improved resilience to noise. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of DDICA across a range of applications, including simulated signal mixtures, hyperspectral image unmixing, modeling of primary visual receptive fields, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DDICA effectively separates independent components with high accuracy across a range of applications. These findings suggest that DDICA offers a robust and versatile solution for blind source separation in diverse signal processing tasks.",

We propose a sparse signed message passing network that is naturally robust to edge noise and heterophily, which can be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. By combining (i) posterior marginalization over signed graph structures with (ii) sparse signed message aggregation, our approach offers a principled way to handle both edge noise and heterophily.

To address these challenges, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that achieves physical dynamics invariance by directly optimizing force/torque inputs, eliminating the need for traditional intermediate control layers. Our architecture integrates a temporal trajectory encoder, which processes finite-horizon reference positions/velocities, with a latent dynamics encoder trained on historical state-action pairs to model platform-specific characteristics. Additionally, we introduce scale-aware dynamics randomization parameterized by the quadrotor's arm length, enabling our approach to maintain stability across drones spanning from 30g to 2.1kg and outperform other DRL baselines by 85% in tracking accuracy. Extensive real-world validation of our approach on the Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor, encompassing over 200 flights, demonstrates robust adaptation to wind, ground effects, and swinging payloads while achieving less than 0.05m RMSE at speeds up to 2.0 m/s.

An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded.

      "content": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been introduced to FL to seek flatter, more robust minima, existing approaches typically apply a uniform perturbation radius across all clients, ignoring client-specific heterogeneity. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST under various degrees of Dirichlet-based label skew demonstrate that FedSCAM achieves competitive performance among state-of-the-art baselines, including FedSAM, FedLESAM, etc. in terms of convergence speed and final test accuracy.",

The approach combines TF-IDF with topic modeling and dimensionality reduction, using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to encode latent topical organization, and fuses these representations with a compact contextual encoder (all-MiniLM). By jointly capturing term-level and topic-level semantics, topic-enriched embeddings improve semantic clustering, increase retrieval precision, and reduce computational burden relative to purely contextual baselines.

      "content": "In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.",

We propose Listen, Attend, Understand (LAU), a semantic regularization technique that constrains the acoustic encoder's latent space during training. By leveraging frozen text embeddings to provide a directional auxiliary loss, LAU injects linguistic groundedness into the acoustic representation without increasing inference cost. We evaluate our method on a Bambara-to-French dataset with 30 hours of Bambara speech translated by non-professionals. Experimental results demonstrate that LAU models achieve comparable performance by standard metrics compared to an E2E-ST system pretrained with 100\\% more data and while performing better in preserving semantic meaning. Furthermore, we introduce Total Parameter Drift as a metric to quantify the structural impact of regularization to demonstrate that semantic constraints actively reorganize the encoder's weights to prioritize meaning over literal phonetics.

Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation. In experiments, the GAI-based semantic segmentation networks, i.e., GAIN, can achieve78.8 mIoU with 22.3 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.6 mIoU with 64.5 on CamVid using an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, which are the new state-of-the-art results of low-latency semantic segmentation.

This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins.",

      "content": "Diffusion inversion is a task of recovering the noise of an image in a diffusion model, which is vital for controllable diffusion image editing. At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step. The extensive experiments show that our DeepInv can achieve much better performance and inference speed than the compared methods, e.g., +40.435% SSIM than EasyInv and +9887.5% speed than ReNoise on COCO dataset. Moreover, our careful designs of trainable solvers can also provide insights to the community. Codes and model parameters will be released in https://github.com/potato-kitty/DeepInv.",

Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes.",

      "content": "Rule-based reasoning over natural language input arises in domains where decisions must be auditable and justifiable: clinical protocols specify eligibility criteria in prose, evidence rules define admissibility through textual conditions, and scientific standards dictate methodological requirements. Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.",

      "content": "Precise delineation of anatomical and pathological structures within 3D medical volumes is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective surgical planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.",

We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible \"explicit world model\" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.",

      "content": "Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

      "content": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\\theta)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\\theta$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\\theta)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\\theta)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\\theta)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(\\theta)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.",

      "content": "Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing local data. However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy.",

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.",

An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns.   Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside.

      "content": "Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method.",

      "content": "Marine oil spills are urgent environmental hazards that demand rapid and reliable detection to minimise ecological and economic damage. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception.",

      "content": "Recent works propose extending 3DGS with semantic feature vectors for simultaneous semantic segmentation and image rendering. However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates.",

Inference on graph-structured data requires methods that are permutation-invariant, scalable across varying sizes and sparsities, and capable of capturing complex long-range dependencies, making posterior estimation on graph parameters particularly challenging. Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework that employs generative neural networks to enable fast, likelihood-free posterior inference. We adapt ABI to graph data to address these challenges to perform inference on node-, edge-, and graph-level parameters. Our approach couples permutation-invariant graph encoders with flexible neural posterior estimators in a two-module pipeline: a summary network maps attributed graphs to fixed-length representations, and an inference network approximates the posterior over parameters. In this setting, several neural architectures can serve as the summary network.

      "content": "With the development of hardware-optimized deployment of spiking neural networks (SNNs), SNN processors based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become a research hotspot due to their efficiency and flexibility. However, existing methods rely on multi-timestep training and reconfigurable computing architectures, which increases computational and memory overhead, thus reducing deployment efficiency. This work presents an efficient and lightweight residual SNN accelerator that combines algorithm and hardware co-design to optimize inference energy efficiency. In terms of the algorithm, we employ single-timesteps training, integrate grouped convolutions, and fuse batch normalization (BN) layers, thus compressing the network to only 0.69M parameters. Quantization-aware training (QAT) further constrains all parameters to 8-bit precision. In terms of hardware, the reuse of intra-layer resources maximizes FPGA utilization, a full pipeline cross-layer architecture improves throughput, and on-chip block RAM (BRAM) stores network parameters and intermediate results to improve memory efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed processor achieves a classification accuracy of 87.11% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with an inference time of 3.98 ms per image and an energy efficiency of 183.5 FPS/W. Compared with mainstream graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, it achieves more than double the energy efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other SNN processors, it achieves at least a 4x faster inference speed and a 5x higher energy efficiency.",

However, existing screening tools - primarily developed using populations from high-income countries - often underperform in Bangladesh and South Asia, where risk profiles differ. Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets. Compared with existing screening tools, the proposed models achieved substantially higher accuracy and sensitivity while requiring fewer and more accessible inputs. External validation confirmed strong generalizability with 78% to 98% sensitivity. SHAP interpretation identified clinically meaningful predictors consistent with established CKD risk factors.",

This growing trend necessitates advanced benchmarks for the rigorous evaluation of optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive and principled framework for constructing highly realistic and challenging DMOO benchmarks. The proposed framework features several novel components: a generalized formulation that allows the Pareto-optimal Set (PS) to change on hypersurfaces, a mechanism for creating controlled variable contribution imbalances to generate heterogeneous landscapes, and dynamic rotation matrices for inducing time-varying variable interactions and non-separability. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal perturbation mechanism to simulate irregular environmental changes and propose a generalized time-linkage mechanism that systematically embeds historical solution quality into future problems, thereby capturing critical real-world phenomena such as error accumulation and time-deception. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over conventional benchmarks in terms of realism, complexity, and its capability for discriminating state-of-the-art algorithmic performance.

For automating these tasks, service robots must be capable of manipulating arbitrary articulated objects. Recent deep learning methods have been shown to predict valuable priors on the affordance of articulated objects from vision. In contrast, many other works estimate object articulations by observing the articulation motion, but this requires the robot to already be capable of manipulating the object. In this article, we propose a novel approach combining these methods by using a factor graph for online estimation of articulation which fuses learned visual priors and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into an analytical model of articulation based on Screw Theory. With our method, a robotic system makes an initial prediction of articulation from vision before touching the object, and then quickly updates the estimate from kinematic and force sensing during manipulation. We evaluate our method extensively in both simulations and real-world robotic manipulation experiments. We demonstrate several closed-loop estimation and manipulation experiments in which the robot was capable of opening previously unseen drawers. In real hardware experiments, the robot achieved a 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects.",

      "content": "Current evaluation paradigms for emotional support conversations tend to reward generic empathetic responses, yet they fail to assess whether the support is genuinely personalized to users' unique psychological profiles and contextual needs. We introduce EmoHarbor, an automated evaluation framework that adopts a User-as-a-Judge paradigm by simulating the user's inner world. EmoHarbor employs a Chain-of-Agent architecture that decomposes users' internal processes into three specialized roles, enabling agents to interact with supporters and complete assessments in a manner similar to human users. We instantiate this benchmark using 100 real-world user profiles that cover a diverse range of personality traits and situations, and define 10 evaluation dimensions of personalized support quality. Comprehensive evaluation of 20 advanced LLMs on EmoHarbor reveals a critical insight: while these models excel at generating empathetic responses, they consistently fail to tailor support to individual user contexts. This finding reframes the central challenge, shifting research focus from merely enhancing generic empathy to developing truly user-aware emotional support. EmoHarbor provides a reproducible and scalable framework to guide the development and evaluation of more nuanced and user-aware emotional support systems.",

These spaces belong to a family of Riemannian manifolds referred to as symmetric spaces of noncompact type. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for developing neural networks on such spaces. Our approach relies on a unified formulation of the distance from a point to a hyperplane on the considered spaces. We show that some existing formulations of the point-to-hyperplane distance can be recovered by our approach under specific settings. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the point-to-hyperplane distance in higher-rank symmetric spaces of noncompact type equipped with G-invariant Riemannian metrics. The derived distance then serves as a tool to design fully-connected (FC) layers and an attention mechanism for neural networks on the considered spaces.

Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to simulate particle-based fluid dynamics models. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry.",

      "content": "Federated learning has been extensively studied and applied due to its ability to ensure data security in distributed environments while building better models. However, clients participating in federated learning still face limitations, as clients with different structures or tasks cannot participate in learning together. In view of this, constructing a federated learning framework that allows collaboration between clients with different model structures and performing different tasks, enabling them to share valuable knowledge to enhance model efficiency, holds significant practical implications for the widespread application of federated learning. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-task federated learning with encoder-decoder structure (M-Fed). Specifically, given the widespread adoption of the encoder-decoder architecture in current models, we leverage this structure to share intra-task knowledge through traditional federated learning methods and extract general knowledge from the encoder to achieve cross-task knowledge sharing. The training process is similar to traditional federated learning, and we incorporate local decoder and global decoder information into the loss function. The local decoder iteratively updates and gradually approaches the global decoder until sufficient cross-task knowledge sharing is achieved. Our method is lightweight and modular, demonstrating innovation compared to previous research. It enables clients performing different tasks to share general knowledge while maintaining the efficiency of traditional federated learning systems. We conducted experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets to verify the feasibility of M-Fed and compared it with traditional methods.

      "content": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

Using frontier machine learning to project patent citation networks in hyperbolic space, we analyze 4.9 million U.S. patents to examine how search strategies give rise to distinct temporal patterns in impact accumulation. We find that inventions based on deep search, which relies on a specialized understanding of complex recombination structures, drive higher short-term impact through early adoption within specialized communities, but face diminishing returns as innovations become \"locked-in\" with limited diffusion potential. Conversely, when inventions are grounded in broad search that spans disparate domains, they encounter initial resistance but achieve wider diffusion and greater long-term impact by reaching cognitively diverse audiences. Individual inventions require both depth and breadth for stable impact. Organizations can strategically balance approaches across multiple inventions: using depth to build reliable technological infrastructure while pursuing breadth to expand applications. We advance innovation theory by demonstrating how deep and broad search strategies distinctly shape the timing and trajectory of technological impact, and how individual inventors and organizations can leverage these mechanisms to balance exploitation and exploration.",

These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes.

To address this, we introduce a latent-constrained CVAE (LC-CVAE) that enforces cross-realization homogeneity of latent embeddings at a small set of shared geographic 'anchor' locations. We then use multi-output Gaussian process regression in the latent space to predict latent coordinates at unsampled locations in a new realization, followed by decoding to generate full time series fields. Experiments and ablations demonstrate (i) instability when training on a single realization, (ii) diminishing returns after incorporating roughly five realizations, and (iii) a trade-off between spatial coverage and reconstruction quality that is closely linked to the average neighbor distance in latent space.",

In this work, we propose TDA-Alz, a novel framework for four-stage Alzheimer's disease severity classification (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild, and very mild) using topological data analysis (TDA) and ensemble learning. Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.   Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations. These results indicate that TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning models for MRI-based Alzheimer's disease severity classification, with strong potential for real-world clinical decision-support systems.",

While existing language model-based methods achieve remarkable performance by combining offline column representation learning with online ranking, their design insufficiently accounts for the underlying structural interactions: (1) offline, they directly model tables into isolated or pairwise columns, thereby struggling to capture the rich inter-table and intra-table structural information; and (2) online, they rank candidate columns based solely on query-candidate similarity, ignoring the mutual interactions among the candidates, leading to incoherent result sets. To address these limitations, we propose HyperJoin, a large language model (LLM)-augmented Hypergraph framework for Joinable table discovery. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph to model tables using both the intra-table hyperedges and the LLM-augmented inter-table hyperedges. Consequently, the task of joinable table discovery is formulated as link prediction on this constructed hypergraph. We then design HIN, a Hierarchical Interaction Network that learns expressive column representations through bidirectional message passing over columns and hyperedges. To strengthen coherence and internal consistency in the result columns, we cast online ranking as a coherence-aware top-k column selection problem. We then introduce a reranking module that leverages a maximum spanning tree algorithm to prune noisy connections and maximize coherence. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of HyperJoin, achieving average improvements of 21.4% (Precision@15) and 17.2% (Recall@15) over the best baseline.",

We first fine-tune the LLM with synthesized parallel data. Then, we further train the LLM with PPO, where the rewards are elaborately designed for distinguishing the stylistic intensity in hierarchical levels. Both the global and local stylistic features are considered to formulate the reward functions. The experiments on two UTST benchmarks showcase that both rewards have their advantages and applying them to LLM fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of an LLM backbone based on various evaluation metrics.

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.

      "content": "Introduction: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) arises from diverse comorbidities and progresses through prolonged subclinical stages, making early diagnosis and prognosis difficult. Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.   Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.   Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.   Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.",

      "content": "Label assignment is a critical component in training dense object detectors. State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. Notably, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with RFAssigner achieves state-of-the-art performance across all object scales, consistently outperforming existing strategies without requiring auxiliary modules or heuristics.",

      "content": "Universal approximation theorems show that neural networks can approximate any continuous function; however, the number of parameters may grow exponentially with the ambient dimension, so these results do not fully explain the practical success of deep models on high-dimensional data. Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \\le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\\mathscr{B}^{s,\\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved. Our results clarify how depth reduces regularity requirements for efficient representation, offering a more precise explanation for the performance of deep architectures beyond the classical Barron setting, and for their stable use in high-dimensional problems used today.",

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers.",

      "content": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in experimental settings, but they systematically diverge from human decisions in complex decision-making environments, where participants must anticipate others' actions and form beliefs based on observed behavior. We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

Deep learning-based Radar Echo Extrapolation (REE) has become a predominant nowcasting approach, yet it suffers from poor generalization due to its reliance on high-quality local training data and static model parameters, limiting its applicability across diverse regions and extreme events. To overcome this, we propose REE-TTT, a novel model that incorporates an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanism. The core of our model lies in the newly designed Spatio-temporal Test-Time Training (ST-TTT) block, which replaces the standard linear projections in TTT layers with task-specific attention mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to non-stationary meteorological distributions and thereby significantly enhancing the feature representation of precipitation. Experiments under cross-regional extreme precipitation scenarios demonstrate that REE-TTT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy and generalization, exhibiting remarkable adaptability to data distribution shifts.",

Within this framework, we develop a preference-based adversarial attack to generate hard instances that expose solver weaknesses, and quantify the attack impact by the resulting degradation on Pareto-front quality. We further introduce a defense strategy that integrates hardness-aware preference selection into adversarial training to reduce overfitting to restricted preference regions and improve out-of-distribution performance. The experimental results on multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) verify that our attack method successfully learns hard instances for different solvers.

      "content": "Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup.",

Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%.",

While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision.

This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets.

Existing approaches primarily focus on minimizing interference between concepts, often neglecting the potential for positive inter-concept interactions. In this work, we present Forget Less by Learning from Parents (FLLP), a novel framework that introduces a parent-child inter-concept learning mechanism in hyperbolic space to mitigate forgetting. By embedding concept representations within a Lorentzian manifold, naturally suited to modeling tree-like hierarchies, we define parent-child relationships in which previously learned concepts serve as guidance for adapting to new ones. Our method not only preserves prior knowledge but also supports continual integration of new concepts. We validate FLLP on three public datasets and one synthetic benchmark, showing consistent improvements in both robustness and generalization.",

      "content": "Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.   We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.",

However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing.

We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$\\rho$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth.

      "content": "Accurate detection of ultrasound nodules is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid and breast cancers. However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.",

While MCP standardises how LLMs invoke tools, current BIM-side implementations are still authoring tool-specific and ad hoc, limiting reuse, evaluation, and workflow portability across environments. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular reference architecture for MCP servers that enables API-agnostic, isolated and reproducible agentic BIM interactions. From a systematic analysis of recurring capabilities in recent literature, we derive a core set of requirements. These inform a microservice architecture centred on an explicit adapter contract that decouples the MCP interface from specific BIM-APIs. A prototype implementation using IfcOpenShell demonstrates feasibility across common modification and generation tasks. Evaluation across representative scenarios shows that the architecture enables reliable workflows, reduces coupling, and provides a reusable foundation for systematic research.",

      "content": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced and show strong promise for text-based person search (TBPS), a task that requires capturing fine-grained relationships between images and text to distinguish individuals. Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

      "content": "Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.",

To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

We present Overlapping Local Decentralized SGD (OLDSGD), a novel approach to accelerate decentralized training by computation-communication overlapping, significantly reducing network idle time. With a deliberately designed update, OLDSGD preserves the same average update as Local SGD while avoiding communication-induced stalls. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for smooth non-convex objectives, showing that OLDSGD retains the same iteration complexity as standard Local Decentralized SGD while improving per-iteration runtime. Empirical results demonstrate OLDSGD's consistent improvements in wall-clock time convergence under different levels of communication delays.

This localized structure enables effective transfer where similarity is present while limiting negative transfer elsewhere. We introduce estimators that jointly learn the local transfer functions and the target regression, together with fully data-driven procedures that adapt to unknown partition structure and transfer strength. We establish sharp minimax rates for target regression estimation, showing that local transfer can mitigate the curse of dimensionality by exploiting reduced functional complexity.

To reconcile generative structure with discriminative performance, we introduce the \\emph{Discriminative Negative Log-Likelihood} (DNLL) loss, which augments the LDA log-likelihood with a simple penalty on the mixture density.

Edge devices, as the primary platforms directly serving users, play a crucial role in delivering multi-task services. However, current multi-task models are often large, and user task demands are increasingly diverse. Deploying such models directly on edge devices not only increases the burden on these devices but also leads to task redundancy. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a pre-trained multi-task model pruning method specifically designed for edge computing. The goal is to utilize existing pre-trained multi-task models to construct a compact multi-task model that meets the needs of edge devices. The specific implementation steps are as follows: First, decompose the tasks within the pre-trained multi-task model and select tasks based on actual user needs. Next, while retaining the knowledge of the original pre-trained model, evaluate parameter importance and use a parameter fusion method to effectively integrate shared parameters among tasks. Finally, obtain a compact multi-task model suitable for edge devices. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three public image datasets. The experimental results fully demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of this method, providing a new solution for multi-task learning on edge devices.",

      "content": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.",

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.",

Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon.

A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization.

However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.",

Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $\\Gamma$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition.",

      "content": "Understanding affective polarization in online discourse is crucial for evaluating the societal impact of social media interactions. This study presents a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-informed heuristics to systematically analyze and quantify affective polarization in discussions on divisive topics such as climate change and gun control. Unlike most prior approaches that relied on sentiment analysis or predefined classifiers, our method integrates LLMs to extract stance, affective tone, and agreement patterns from large-scale social media discussions. We then apply a rule-based scoring system capable of quantifying affective polarization even in small conversations consisting of single interactions, based on stance alignment, emotional content, and interaction dynamics. Our analysis reveals distinct polarization patterns that are event dependent: (i) anticipation-driven polarization, where extreme polarization escalates before well-publicized events, and (ii) reactive polarization, where intense affective polarization spikes immediately after sudden, high-impact events. By combining AI-driven content annotation with domain-informed scoring, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to measuring affective polarization.

We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret.

It outputs validated installed and uninstalled component sets for online state tracking. Module II, Human-Aware Planning and Replanning (HPR), performs task-level multi-robot assignment and updates the plan only when the observed state deviates from the expected execution outcome. It applies a minimal-change replanning rule to selectively revise task assignments and preserve plan stability even under human interventions. We validate the framework on a 27-component timber-frame assembly. The PSS module achieves 97% state synthesis accuracy, and the HPR module maintains feasible task progression across diverse HRC scenarios.

Multi-agent systems can enhance efficiency through collaboration, but the scalability of motion-planning algorithms remains a key limitation.

This work addresses that limitation by leveraging autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction, compressing high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent state vectors while preserving essential spatial information. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedural generation algorithm based on Perlin noise, designed to generate topologically complex training environments that simulate asteroid fields, caves and forests. These environments are used for training the autoencoder and the navigation algorithm using a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for decentralized coordination. We introduce a weighted consensus mechanism that modulates reliance on shared data via a tuneable trust parameter, ensuring robustness to accumulation of errors.

Given modern seismic acquisition systems, the data (as input for FWI) required for an industrial-strength case is in the teraflop level of storage, therefore solving complex subsurface cases or exploring multiple scenarios with FWI become prohibitive. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion.",

This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage.

To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks.

      "content": "The anticipated positive social impact of regulatory processes requires both the accuracy and efficiency of their application. Modern artificial intelligence technologies, including natural language processing and machine-assisted reasoning, hold great promise for addressing this challenge. We present a framework to address the challenge of tools for regulatory application, based on current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for natural language processing (large language models or LLMs) and formalization of legal reasoning (the legal representation system PROLEG). As an example, we focus on Article 6 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In our framework, a single LLM prompt simultaneously transforms legal text into if-then rules and a corresponding PROLEG encoding, which are then validated and refined by legal domain experts. The final output is an executable PROLEG program that can produce human-readable explanations for instances of GDPR decisions. We describe processes to support the end-to-end transformation of a segment of a regulatory document (Article 6 from GDPR), including the prompting frame to guide an LLM to \"compile\" natural language text to if-then rules, then to further \"compile\" the vetted if-then rules to PROLEG. Finally, we produce an instance that shows the PROLEG execution. We conclude by summarizing the value of this approach and note observed limitations with suggestions to further develop such technologies for capturing and deploying regulatory frameworks.",

However, the efficiency of these prediction sets, measured by their size, depends on the choice of the underlying learning model. Relying on a single fixed model may lead to suboptimal performance in online environments, as a single model may not consistently perform well across all time steps. To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency. At each time step, a bipartite graph is generated to identify a subset of effective models, from which a model is selected to construct the prediction set. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing multi-model conformal prediction techniques in terms of both prediction set size and computational efficiency.",

Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional accuracy and realism in modeling two-person 3D dialogue motion, significantly advancing the fidelity and controllability of audio-driven talking heads.",

We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.",

Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency.

However, preferences often come with uncertainty and noise if they are not from perfect teachers.

In this work, we formalize the notion of targeted feature-dependent noise and propose several variants like trajectory feature noise, trajectory similarity noise, uncertainty-aware noise, and Language Model noise.   We evaluate feature-dependent noise, where noise is correlated with certain features in complex continuous control tasks from DMControl and Meta-world. Our experiments show that in some feature-dependent noise settings, the state-of-the-art noise-robust PbRL method's learning performance is significantly deteriorated, while PbRL method with no explicit denoising can surprisingly outperform noise-robust PbRL in majority settings.

Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting.

By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones. Extensive experiments, across three datasets, demonstrates that our method significantly improves concept retention and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the effectiveness of inter-concept catalytic behavior in incremental concept learning of ten tasks with at least 2% gain on average CLIP Image Alignment scores.",

      "content": "A remarkable capability of the human brain is to form more abstract conceptual representations from sensorimotor experiences and flexibly apply them independent of direct sensory inputs. However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence.",

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.

      "content": "Device-free crowd-counting using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) is a key enabling technology for a new generation of privacy-preserving Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\\% vs. 99.67\\%) while training 97.2\\% fewer parameters.

      "content": "Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI.

One of my goals for Q1 2026 is to write unified explainer posts for all the standard economic debates around potential AI futures in a systematic fashion.

Singular learning theory replaces this assumption with the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), an effective dimension that can be strictly smaller in overparameterized or rank-deficient models.   We study linear-Gaussian rank models and linear subspace (dictionary) models in which the exact marginal likelihood is available in closed form and the RLCT is analytically tractable. In this setting, we show theoretically and empirically that the error of Laplace/BIC grows linearly with (d/2 minus lambda) times log n, where d is the ambient parameter dimension and lambda is the RLCT. An RLCT-aware correction recovers the correct evidence slope and is invariant to overcomplete reparameterizations that represent the same data subspace.

MediaPipe enables real-time hand tracking and precise extraction of hand joint coordinates, which serve as input features for the PBRC architecture. The proposed PBRC architecture consists of two echo state network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) modules arranged in parallel to capture temporal dependencies, thereby creating a rich feature representation for classification. We trained our PBRC-based SLR system on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies of 60.85%, 85.86%, and 91.74%, respectively.

      "content": "Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Julian075/CATALOG/tree/WildIng.",

      "content": "Social cues, which convey others' presence, behaviors, or identities, play a crucial role in human information seeking by helping individuals judge relevance and trustworthiness. However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions.",

PlaylistSense encompasses ten types of user queries derived from common real-world perspectives, challenging LLMs to accurately grasp playlist features and address diverse user intents. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that current general-purpose LLMs still have potential for improvement in playlist understanding. Inspired by this, we introduce SongSage, a large musical language model equipped with diverse lyric-centric intelligence through lyric generative pretraining. SongSage undergoes continual pretraining on LyricBank, a carefully curated corpus of 5.48 billion tokens focused on lyrical content, followed by fine-tuning with LyricBank-SFT, a meticulously crafted instruction set comprising 775k samples across nine core lyric-centric tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SongSage exhibits a strong understanding of lyric-centric knowledge, excels in rewriting user queries for zero-shot playlist recommendations, generates and continues lyrics effectively, and performs proficiently across seven additional capabilities. Beyond its lyric-centric expertise, SongSage also retains general knowledge comprehension and achieves a competitive MMLU score.

      "content": "The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds poses a significant challenge for objective quality assessment (PCQA), particularly in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence. To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

Current certifications typically rely either on global Lipschitz bounds, which are often conservative, or on local gradient information, which provides only a first-order approximation. This paper introduces a novel geometric framework based on the least concave majorants of the growth rate function. Our proposed concave certificate establishes a tight bound of DR risk that remains applicable to non-Lipschitz and non-differentiable losses. We extend this framework to complexity analysis, introducing a deterministic bound that complements standard statistical generalization bound. Furthermore, we utilize this certificate to bound the gap between adversarial and empirical Rademacher complexity, demonstrating that dependencies on input diameter, network width, and depth can be eliminated. For practical application in deep learning, we introduce the adversarial score as a tractable relaxation of the concave certificate that enables efficient and layer-wise analysis of neural networks.

Building upon paired data, we propose the first Diffusion Transformer-based framework DreamID-V, employing a core Modality-Aware Conditioning module to discriminatively inject multi-model conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a Synthetic-to-Real Curriculum mechanism and an Identity-Coherence Reinforcement Learning strategy to enhance visual realism and identity consistency under challenging scenarios.

Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design.

Specifically, our analysis shows that the simple Empirical Utility Maximization (EUM) algorithm yields an $\\varepsilon$-approximation of the optimal linear contract with probability at least $1-\\delta$, using just $O(\\ln(1/\\delta) / \\varepsilon^2)$ samples. This result improves upon previously known bounds and matches a lower bound from Duetting et al. [2025] up to constant factors, thereby proving its optimality. Our analysis uses a chaining argument, where the key insight is to leverage a simple structural property of linear contracts: their expected reward is non-decreasing. This property, which holds even though the utility function itself is non-monotone and discontinuous, enables the construction of fine-grained nets required for the chaining argument, which in turn yields the optimal sample complexity. Furthermore, our proof establishes the stronger guarantee of uniform convergence: the empirical utility of every linear contract is a $\\varepsilon$-approximation of its true expectation with probability at least $1-\\delta$, using the same optimal $O(\\ln(1/\\delta) / \\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity.",

      "content": "Manual font design is an intricate process that transforms a stylistic visual concept into a coherent glyph set. This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation. GAR-Font introduces a global-aware tokenizer that effectively captures both local structures and global stylistic patterns, a multimodal style encoder offering flexible style control through a lightweight language-style adapter without requiring intensive multimodal pretraining, and a post-refinement pipeline that further enhances structural fidelity and style coherence. Extensive experiments show that GAR-Font outperforms existing FFG methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.",

      "content": "Anomaly detection is increasingly becoming crucial for maintaining the safety, reliability, and efficiency of industrial systems. Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection.",

      "content": "Biclustering is an essential unsupervised machine learning technique for simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a data matrix, with widespread applications in genomics, transcriptomics, and other high-dimensional omics data. Despite its importance, existing biclustering methods struggle to meet the demands of modern large-scale datasets. The challenges stem from the accumulation of noise in high-dimensional features, the limitations of non-convex optimization formulations, and the computational complexity of identifying meaningful biclusters. These issues often result in reduced accuracy and stability as the size of the dataset increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse Convex Biclustering (SpaCoBi), a novel method that penalizes noise during the biclustering process to improve both accuracy and robustness. By adopting a convex optimization framework and introducing a stability-based tuning criterion, SpaCoBi achieves an optimal balance between cluster fidelity and sparsity. Comprehensive numerical studies, including simulations and an application to mouse olfactory bulb data, demonstrate that SpaCoBi significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy. These results highlight SpaCoBi as a robust and efficient solution for biclustering in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.",

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in synthesizing complex financial data and textual information but have not been applied to post-IPO exit decisions. This study introduces a framework that uses LLMs to estimate the optimal time for VC exit by analyzing monthly post IPO information financial performance, filings, news, and market signals and recommending whether to sell or continue holding. We compare these LLM generated recommendations with the actual exit dates observed for VCs and compute the return differences between the two strategies. By quantifying gains or losses associated with following the LLM, this study provides evidence on whether AI-driven guidance can improve exit timing and complements traditional hazard and real-options models in venture capital research.",

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness.

      "content": "This paper introduces SENA (SEamlessly NAtural), a geometry-driven image stitching approach that prioritizes structural fidelity in challenging real-world scenes characterized by parallax and depth variation. Conventional image stitching relies on homographic alignment, but this rigid planar assumption often fails in dual-camera setups with significant scene depth, leading to distortions such as visible warps and spherical bulging. SENA addresses these fundamental limitations through three key contributions. First, we propose a hierarchical affine-based warping strategy, combining global affine initialization with local affine refinement and smooth free-form deformation. This design preserves local shape, parallelism, and aspect ratios, thereby avoiding the hallucinated structural distortions commonly introduced by homography-based models. Second, we introduce a geometry-driven adequate zone detection mechanism that identifies parallax-minimized regions directly from the disparity consistency of RANSAC-filtered feature correspondences, without relying on semantic segmentation. Third, building upon this adequate zone, we perform anchor-based seamline cutting and segmentation, enforcing a one-to-one geometric correspondence across image pairs by construction, which effectively eliminates ghosting, duplication, and smearing artifacts in the final panorama.   Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets demonstrate that SENA achieves alignment accuracy comparable to leading homography-based methods, while significantly outperforming them in critical visual metrics such as shape preservation, texture integrity, and overall visual realism.",

      "content": "Accurate quantification of local strain fields during bladder contraction is essential for understanding the biomechanics of bladder micturition, in both health and disease. Conventional digital image correlation (DIC) methods have been successfully applied to various biological tissues; however, this approach requires artificial speckling, which can alter both passive and active properties of the tissue. In this study, we introduce a speckle-free framework for quantifying local strain fields using a state-of-the-art, zero-shot transformer model, CoTracker3. We utilized a custom-designed, portable isotonic biaxial apparatus compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to demonstrate this approach, successfully tracking natural bladder lumen textures without artificial markers. Benchmark tests validated the method's high pixel accuracy and low strain errors. Our framework effectively captured heterogeneous deformation patterns, despite complex folding and buckling, which conventional DIC often fails to track. Application to in vitro active bladder contractions in four rat specimens (n=4) revealed statistically significant anisotropy (p<0.01), with higher contraction longitudinally compared to circumferentially. Multiphoton microscopy further illustrated and confirmed heterogeneous morphological changes, such as large fold formation during active contraction. This non-invasive approach eliminates speckle-induced artifacts, enabling more physiologically relevant measurements, and has broad applicability for material testing of other biological and engineered systems.",

To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion. Experiments on popular datasets (S3DIS, ScanNet) demonstrate the superiority of DA-FSS over MM-FSS. Meanwhile, geometric boundaries, completeness, and texture differentiation are all superior to the baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/MoWenQAQ/DA-FSS.",

While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability. Furthermore, evaluation on an in-house dataset of 91,514 pediatric CT images demonstrates the true generalizability of CAP-IQA in assessing perceptual fidelity in a different patient population.",

In this paper, we present a method that uses both tactile and vision data to estimate the pose of an object grasped in a robot's hand. To address challenges like lack of standard representation for tactile data and sensor fusion, we propose the use of point clouds to represent object surfaces in contact with the tactile sensor and present a network architecture based on pixel-wise dense fusion. We also extend NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dataset Synthesizer to produce synthetic photo-realistic vision data and corresponding tactile point clouds.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering.

These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning.

The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.",

      "content": "This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.",

While classical LDA is a simple Gaussian model with linear decision boundaries, attaching an LDA head to a neural encoder raises the question of how to train the resulting deep classifier by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We first show that end-to-end MLE training of an unconstrained Deep LDA model ignores discrimination: when both the LDA parameters and the encoder parameters are learned jointly, the likelihood admits a degenerate solution in which some of the class clusters may heavily overlap or even collapse, and classification performance deteriorates. Batchwise moment re-estimation of the LDA parameters does not remove this failure mode. We then propose a constrained Deep LDA formulation that fixes the class means to the vertices of a regular simplex in the latent space and restricts the shared covariance to be spherical, leaving only the priors and a single variance parameter to be learned along with the encoder. Under these geometric constraints, MLE becomes stable and yields well-separated class clusters in the latent space. On images (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), the resulting Deep LDA models achieve accuracy competitive with softmax baselines while offering a simple, interpretable latent geometry that is clearly visible in two-dimensional projections.",

      "content": "Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.",

In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling, quality assurance, and targeted dataset curation.",

      "content": "Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.",

To ensure protocol-faithful and fair evaluation, we unify data loading, training, and inference under a single JSON input-output contract and remove avoidable variance by adopting KV-off decoding as the default setting. We incorporate two orthogonal semantic regularizers: a VAD-preserving constraint that aligns generated text with target VAD triples, and a lightweight external appraisal classifier that provides training-time guidance on goal attainment, controllability, certainty, and fairness without injecting long rationales. To improve polarity sensitivity, we introduce Valence Flip augmentation based on mirrored emotional pairs. During supervised fine-tuning, we apply A/B mixture sampling with entropy-aware temperature scheduling to balance coverage and convergence. Using Qwen-1.8B-Chat as the base model, EmoLoom-2B achieves strong performance on GoEmotions and EmpatheticDialogues, and demonstrates robust cross-corpus generalization on DailyDialog.

For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective.

This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%.

To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units.

The framework operates in three stages: First, a conditional diffusion model generates high-fidelity ultrasound images using multimodal conditions for data augmentation. Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.   Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality. The student network had fewer parameters and faster inference.

The proposed method is formulated within an error-state Kalman filtering framework, where LiDAR and leg odometry measurements are integrated with IMU-based state prediction, and measurement noise covariance matrices are adaptively adjusted based on online degeneracy-aware reliability assessment.

However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon)$.

Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention.

Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy.",

      "content": "Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.",

We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase.

We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\\%, $\\sigma$=3.74\\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increases, indicating that commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation.",

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\\% while maintaining 92.3\\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers.",

      "content": "What are transformers, and some ways to think about them.&nbsp;Modern LLMs are Transformers. An LLM is a transformer in the same way that a building might be a ‘Art Deco building’ – specific instances of a general architecture. Like with Art Deco, there are many variants of buildings that would still be considered the same style. Similarly, while there are many different variants of transformer-based LLMs, they all follow a similar architecture. However, not every building is a Art Deco building. And there exist LLMs that are not transformers. That being said, with modern LLMs today, virtually all decent models are transformers.Art Deco isn’t just an architectural style. You also have fashion, jewelery, furniture – even fonts! – that we call Art Deco. Similarly, this same transformer architecture, can also be applied to various models beyond text. You can have transformers trained to understand images, parse DNA sequences, generate audio, and so on.How can transformers do all these different things? Well, at its core, a transformer is a&nbsp;next token prediction machine. In text, tokens are fragments of words. We feed the model a string of input text. It reads it all at once, and comes up with a prediction for the word-fragment that’s most likely to follow everything that’s come so far. Then you take this new token, glom it onto the rest, and pass the entire thing through the model again. And you repeat this until you’ve got as many tokens as you want.This process isn’t limited to text, though. As long as you can convert something into tokens – sequence-fragments – you can put it through a transformer. DNA sequences can be broken up into smaller lengths; audio can be split into shorter snippets. I don’t know it works for images, but there’s certainly some clever way to segment them up as well.——&nbsp;“Transformer” is a confusing term, because there are two things it can mean.

However, the presence of missing observations in real-world datasets often complicates the application of the model.

In this paper, we propose a collapsed Gibbs sampler that efficiently samples from HMMs' posterior by integrating out both the missing observations and the corresponding latent states. The proposed sampler is fast due to its three advantages. First, it achieves an estimation accuracy that is comparable to existing methods. Second, it can produce a larger Effective Sample Size (ESS) per iteration, which can be justified theoretically and numerically. Third, when the number of missing entries is large, the sampler has a significant smaller computational complexity per iteration compared to other methods, thus is faster computationally. In summary, the proposed sampling algorithm is fast both computationally and theoretically and is particularly advantageous when there are a lot of missing entries. Finally, empirical evaluations based on numerical simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing algorithms in terms of time complexity and sampling efficiency (measured in ESS).",

Current standard practices in PCC highlight a primary issue: while single-feature metrics are widely used to assess compression distortion, the classic method of searching point-to-point nearest neighbors frequently fails to adequately build precise correspondences between point clouds, resulting in an ineffective capture of human perceptual features. To overcome the related limitations, we propose a novel assessment method called RBFIM, utilizing radial basis function (RBF) interpolation to convert discrete point features into a continuous feature function for the distorted point cloud. By substituting the geometry coordinates of the original point cloud into the feature function, we obtain the bijective sets of point features. This enables an establishment of precise corresponding features between distorted and original point clouds and significantly improves the accuracy of quality assessments. Moreover, this method avoids the complexity caused by bidirectional searches. Extensive experiments on multiple subjective quality datasets of compressed point clouds demonstrate that our RBFIM excels in addressing human perception tasks, thereby providing robust support for PCC optimization efforts.",

      "content": "We introduce a novel FSVOS model that employs a local matching strategy to restrict the search space to the most relevant neighboring pixels. Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.",

Achieving this vision is highly challenging and requires much more than just language modeling. It involves numerous complex AI challenges, such as conversational AI, maintaining character integrity, managing personality and emotions, handling knowledge and memory, synthesizing voice, generating animations, enabling real-world interactions, and integration with physical environments. Recent advancements in the development of foundation models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks have enabled researchers to address these individual challenges. However, combining these technologies for interactive characters remains an open problem. We present a system and platform for conveniently designing believable digital characters, enabling a conversational and story-driven experience while providing solutions to all of the technical challenges. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce Digital Einstein, which allows users to engage in conversations with a digital representation of Albert Einstein about his life, research, and persona. While Digital Einstein exemplifies our methods for a specific character, our system is flexible and generalizes to any story-driven or conversational character. By unifying these diverse AI components into a single, easy-to-adapt platform, our work paves the way for immersive character experiences, turning the dream of lifelike, story-based interactions into a reality.",

      "content": "Cloud storage has become the backbone of modern data infrastructure, yet privacy and efficient data retrieval remain significant challenges. Traditional privacy-preserving approaches primarily focus on enhancing database security but fail to address the automatic identification of sensitive information before encryption. This can dramatically reduce query processing time and mitigate errors during manual identification of sensitive information, thereby reducing potential privacy risks. To address this limitation, this research proposes an intelligent privacy-preserving query optimization framework that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect sensitive information in queries, utilizing secure data encryption and query optimization techniques for both sensitive and non-sensitive data in parallel, thereby enabling efficient database optimization. Combined deep learning algorithms and transformer-based models to detect and classify sensitive entities with high precision, and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt, with blind indexing to secure search functionality of the sensitive data, whereas non-sensitive data was divided into groups using the K-means algorithm, along with a rank search for optimization. Among all NER models, the Deep Belief Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory (DBN-LSTM) delivers the best performance, with an accuracy of 93% and precision (94%), recall, and F1 score of 93%, and 93%, respectively. Besides, encrypted search achieved considerably faster results with the help of blind indexing, and non-sensitive data fetching also outperformed traditional clustering-based searches.

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

      "content": "Deep learning has been extensively used in medical imaging applications, assuming that the test and training datasets belong to the same probability distribution. However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.",

This paper intends to study search algorithms based on quantum walks in quantum computation and sampling algorithms based on Langevin dynamics in classical computation. On the quantum side, quantum walk-based search algorithms can achieve quadratic speedups over their classical counterparts. In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.   Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that, in terms of the Le Cam deficiency distance, a quantum walk with randomization is asymptotically equivalent to underdamped Langevin dynamics, whereas the quantum walk without randomization is not asymptotically equivalent due to its high-frequency oscillatory behavior. We further discuss the implications of these equivalence and nonequivalence results for the computational and inferential properties of the associated algorithms in machine learning tasks.

However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines.

To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models.

      "content": "Since floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has garnered significant attention. Existing methods either ingeniously match geometric priors or utilize sparse semantics to reduce FLoc uncertainty. However, they still suffer from ambiguous FLoc caused by repetitive structures within minimalist floorplans. Moreover, expensive but limited semantic annotations restrict their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DisCo-FLoc, which utilizes dual-level visual-geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate depth-aware visual Floc, without requiring additional semantic labels. Our solution begins with a ray regression predictor tailored for ray-casting-based FLoc, predicting a series of FLoc candidates using depth estimation expertise. In addition, a novel contrastive learning method with position-level and orientation-level constraints is proposed to strictly match depth-aware visual features with the corresponding geometric structures in the floorplan. Such matches can effectively eliminate FLoc ambiguity and select the optimal imaging pose from FLoc candidates. Exhaustive comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic-based method, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and accuracy.",

      "content": "With the growing demand for real-time video enhancement in live applications, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and effective exposure control, particularly under uneven lighting. We introduce RRNet (Rendering Relighting Network), a lightweight and configurable framework that achieves a state-of-the-art tradeoff between visual quality and efficiency. By estimating parameters for a minimal set of virtual light sources, RRNet enables localized relighting through a depth-aware rendering module without requiring pixel-aligned training data. This object-aware formulation preserves facial identity and supports real-time, high-resolution performance using a streamlined encoder and lightweight prediction head. To facilitate training, we propose a generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline that synthesizes diverse lighting conditions at low cost. With its interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture, RRNet is well suited for practical applications such as video conferencing, AR-based portrait enhancement, and mobile photography. Experiments show that RRNet consistently outperforms prior methods in low-light enhancement, localized illumination adjustment, and glare removal.",

While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

      "content": "Koopman operator theory has emerged as a leading data-driven approach that relies on a judicious choice of observable functions to realize global linear representations of nonlinear systems in the lifted observable space. However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting.",

Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively. A frequency-aware router is further introduced to adaptively guide the contribution of each expert, ensuring robust image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showcase the generalizability of our model in daytime dehazing and low-light enhancement tasks.",

The recent adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution (SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra interactions.

      "content": "Emotional responses during advertising video viewing are recognized as essential for understanding media effects because they have influenced attention, memory, and purchase intention. To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified \"pleasantness,\" \"surprise,\" and \"habituation\" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected \"pleasantness\" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured \"surprise\" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected \"surprise\" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.",

However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).",

While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

      "content": "Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion approaches often rely on textual information at the sentence level, which can lead to semantic noise from redundant text and fail to fully exploit the deeper semantic value of textual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AHG provides a hybrid data augmentation strategy by generating realistic and diverse hazy images as additional high-quality training data. DHR considers hazy regions with varying haze density distributions for generalizable real-world image dehazing in an adaptive patch importance-aware manner. To alleviate the ambiguity of the dehazed image details, we further introduce a new Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss, which fully utilizes information from multiple negative samples across both spatial and frequency domains.

      "content": "Graphs are commonly used in machine learning to model relationships between instances. Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches.",

      "content": "This paper proposes a cutting mechanics-based machine learning (CMML) modeling method to discover governing equations of machining dynamics. The main idea of CMML design is to integrate existing physics in cutting mechanics and unknown physics in data to achieve automated model discovery, with the potential to advance machining modeling. Based on existing physics in cutting mechanics, CMML first establishes a general modeling structure governing machining dynamics, that is represented by a set of unknown differential algebraic equations. CMML can therefore achieve data-driven discovery of these unknown equations through effective cutting mechanics-based nonlinear learning function space design and discrete optimization-based learning algorithm. Experimentally verified time domain simulation of milling is used to validate the proposed modeling method. Numerical results show CMML can discover the exact milling dynamics models with process damping and edge force from noisy data. This indicates that CMML has the potential to be used for advancing machining modeling in practice with the development of effective metrology systems.",

      "content": "The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets. Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further exploration.",

Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called \\textbf{Speak the Art (STA)} which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.",

The method is motivated by structure-preserving integration and thermostat ideas from molecular dynamics, but is used here purely as an optimization heuristic.   We provide the algorithm and limited theoretical observations in idealized settings. On the deterministic Rosenbrock-100D benchmark with 3000 gradient evaluations, FANoS-RMS attains a mean final objective value of $1.74\\times 10^{-2}$, improving substantially over unclipped AdamW ($48.50$) and SGD+momentum ($90.76$) in this protocol.

On ill-conditioned convex quadratics and in a small PINN warm-start suite (Burgers and Allen--Cahn), the default FANoS configuration underperforms AdamW and can be unstable or high-variance.

Each physics concept in our benchmark is decomposed into granular teaching points, with each point accompanied by a carefully crafted prompt intended for visual explanation of the teaching point. T2V models are evaluated on their ability to generate accurate videos in response to these prompts. Our aim is to systematically explore the feasibility of using T2V models to generate high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational content-paving the way toward scalable, accessible, and personalized learning experiences powered by AI. Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict. These findings underscore the gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation.

We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

Traditional digital divide frameworks fail to explain these variations.   Purpose: This study introduces the \"Dependency Divide\", a novel framework proposing that highly engaged students become conditionally vulnerable to infrastructure failures, challenging assumptions that engagement uniformly benefits learners in post-access environments.   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 396 university students in Bangladesh using a three-stage analytical approach: (1) stability-validated K-prototypes clustering to identify student profiles, (2) profile-specific Random Forest models with SHAP and ALE analysis to determine satisfaction drivers, and (3) formal interaction analysis with propensity score matching to test the Dependency Divide hypothesis.   Results: Three distinct profiles emerged: Casually Engaged (58%), Efficient Learners (35%), and Hyper-Engaged (7%). A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.   Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting engagement.",

To enhance model performance under variable system scales and improve robustness in branch power prediction, this paper proposes a Scale-adaptive Multi-task Power Flow Analysis (SaMPFA) framework. SaMPFA introduces a Local Topology Slicing (LTS) sampling technique that extracts subgraphs of different scales from the complete power network to strengthen the model's cross-scale learning capability. Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial grid in China demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior adaptability and generalization under variable system scales, with accuracy improvements of 4.47% and 36.82%, respectively.",

      "content": "The availability of structured legal data is important for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the German legal system. One of the most widely used datasets, Open Legal Data, provides a large-scale collection of German court decisions. While the metadata in this raw dataset is consistently structured, the decision texts themselves are inconsistently formatted and often lack clearly marked sections. Reliable separation of these sections is important not only for rhetorical role classification but also for downstream tasks such as retrieval and citation analysis. In this work, we introduce a cleaned and sectioned dataset of 251,038 German court decisions derived from the official Open Legal Data dataset. We systematically separated three important sections in German court decisions, namely Tenor (operative part of the decision), Tatbestand (facts of the case), and Entscheidungsgr\\\"unde (judicial reasoning), which are often inconsistently represented in the original dataset. To ensure the reliability of our extraction process, we used Cochran's formula with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error to draw a statistically representative random sample of 384 cases, and manually verified that all three sections were correctly identified. We also extracted the Rechtsmittelbelehrung (appeal notice) as a separate field, since it is a procedural instruction and not part of the decision itself. The resulting corpus is publicly available in the JSONL format, making it an accessible resource for further research on the German legal system.",

      "content": "The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.",

Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.",

Although deep learning models for lane detection categorized into segmentation-based, anchor-based, and curve-based methods there remains a scarcity of universally applicable optimization techniques tailored for low-power embedded environments. To overcome this, we propose an innovative Covariance Distribution Optimization (CDO) module specifically designed for efficient, real-time applications. The CDO module aligns lane feature distributions closely with ground-truth labels, significantly enhancing detection accuracy without increasing computational complexity. Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%. The proposed CDO module is characterized by ease of integration into existing systems without structural modifications and utilizes existing model parameters to facilitate ongoing training, thus offering substantial benefits in performance, power efficiency, and operational flexibility in embedded systems.",

      "content": "Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers. However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment.",

Results indicate that the Generative LLM achieved the highest performance across all tasks (Macro F1 0.91), demonstrating superior capability in handling implicit aspects. In contrast, the fine-tuned models exhibited limited performance due to dataset imbalance and architectural capacity constraints.

First, we introduce a reliable evaluation approach for DDG, based on our new evaluation criteria and powered by an LLM-as-a-judge. To provide reference definitions for the evaluation, we also construct a Japanese dataset in collaboration with a professional lexicographer.

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.",

Its highly diverse movement and complex interactions between leader and follower dancers make the understanding and synthesis challenging. We demonstrate that the three-point trajectory available from a virtual reality (VR) device can effectively serve as a dancer's motion descriptor, simplifying the modeling and synthesis of interplay between dancers' full-body motions down to sparse trajectories. Thanks to the low dimensionality, we can employ an efficient MLP network to predict the follower's three-point trajectory directly from the leader's three-point input for certain types of ballroom dancing, addressing the challenge of modeling high-dimensional full-body interaction. It also prevents our method from overfitting thanks to its compact yet explicit representation. By leveraging the inherent structure of the movements and carefully planning the autoregressive procedure, we show a deterministic neural network is able to translate three-point trajectories into a virtual embodied avatar, which is typically considered under-constrained and requires generative models for common motions. In addition, we demonstrate this deterministic approach generalizes beyond small, structured datasets like ballroom dancing, and performs robustly on larger, more diverse datasets such as LaFAN. Our method provides a computationally- and data-efficient solution, opening new possibilities for immersive paired dancing applications.

However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.",

      "content": "This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations.

Prior approaches in stem-to-stem generation can condition on other musical stems but offer limited control over rhythm, and timbre-transfer methods allow users to specify specific rhythms, but cannot condition on musical context. We introduce DARC, a generative drum accompaniment model that conditions both on musical context from other stems and explicit rhythm prompts such as beatboxing or tapping tracks.

Actions for visual navigation are determined by comparing segmented images with the image associated with target nodes.

      "content": "We address the Diverse Traveling Salesman Problem (D-TSP), a bi-criteria optimization challenge that seeks a set of $k$ distinct TSP tours. The objective requires every selected tour to have a length at most $c|T^*|$ (where $|T^*|$ is the optimal tour length) while minimizing the average Jaccard similarity across all tour pairs. This formulation is crucial for applications requiring both high solution quality and fault tolerance, such as logistics planning, robotics pathfinding or strategic patrolling. Current methods are limited: traditional heuristics, such as the Niching Memetic Algorithm (NMA) or bi-criteria optimization, incur high computational complexity $O(n^3)$, while modern neural approaches (e.g., RF-MA3S) achieve limited diversity quality and rely on complex, external mechanisms.   To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that decomposes D-TSP into two efficient steps. First, we utilize a simple Graph Pointer Network (GPN), augmented with an approximated sequence entropy loss, to efficiently sample a large, diverse pool of high-quality tours. This simple modification effectively controls the quality-diversity trade-off without complex external mechanisms. Second, we apply a greedy algorithm that yields a 2-approximation for the dispersion problem to select the final $k$ maximally diverse tours from the generated pool. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On the Berlin instance, our model achieves an average Jaccard index of $0.015$, significantly outperforming NMA ($0.081$) and RF-MA3S. By leveraging GPU acceleration, our GPN structure achieves a near-linear empirical runtime growth of $O(n)$. While maintaining solution diversity comparable to complex bi-criteria algorithms, our approach is over 360 times faster on large-scale instances (783 cities), delivering high-quality TSP solutions with unprecedented efficiency and simplicity.",

To address this disparity, this study introduces a cost-effective, automated framework for creating a comprehensive Hindi text summarization dataset.

The resulting dataset provides a diverse, multi-thematic resource that mirrors the complexity of the original XSUM corpus.

      "content": "R\\'enyi transfer entropy (RTE) is a generalization of classical transfer entropy that replaces Shannon's entropy with R\\'enyi's information measure. This, in turn, introduces a new tunable parameter $\\alpha$, which accounts for sensitivity to low- or high-probability events. Although RTE shows strong potential for analyzing causal relations in complex, non-Gaussian systems, its practical use is limited, primarily due to challenges related to its accurate estimation and interpretation. These difficulties are especially pronounced when working with finite, high-dimensional, or heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of a k-nearest neighbor estimator for both R\\'enyi entropy (RE) and RTE using various synthetic data sets with clear cause-and-effect relationships inherent to their construction. We test the estimator across a broad range of parameters, including sample size, dimensionality, memory length, and R\\'enyi order $\\alpha$. In particular, we apply the estimator to a set of simulated processes with increasing structural complexity, ranging from linear dynamics to nonlinear systems with multi-source couplings. To address interpretational challenges arising from potentially negative RE and RTE values, we introduce three reliability conditions and formulate practical guidelines for tuning the estimator parameters. We show that when the reliability conditions are met and the parameters are calibrated accordingly, the resulting effective RTE estimates accurately capture directional information flow across a broad range of scenarios. Results obtained show that the explanatory power of RTE depends sensitively on the choice of the R\\'{e}nyi parameter $\\alpha$.

This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.",

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).",

High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware.

This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

This study presents the Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS), an innovative IDS that employs the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) for Feature Selection (FS). Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of machine learning methodologies with the EVO Algorithm. The Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) effectively diminished features in the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset from 88 to 38 and in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data from 80 to 43, significantly enhancing computing efficiency. HyIDS incorporates four Machine Learning (ML) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (D_Tree), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed HyIDS was assessed utilizing two real-world intrusion datasets, CIC-DDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, both distinguished by considerable class imbalances. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset has a significant imbalance between DDoS assault samples and legal traffic, while the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset primarily comprises benign traffic with insufficient representation of attack types, complicating the detection of minority attacks. A downsampling technique was employed to balance the datasets, hence improving detection efficacy for both benign and malicious traffic. Twenty-four trials were done, revealing substantial enhancements in categorization accuracy, precision, and recall. Our suggested D_TreeEVO model attained an accuracy rate of 99.13% and an F1 score of 98.94% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and an accuracy rate of 99.78% and an F1 score of 99.70% on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data. These data demonstrate that EVO significantly improves cybersecurity in Cloud Computing (CC).",

      "content": "Personality assessment in career guidance and personnel selection traditionally relies on self-report questionnaires, which are susceptible to response bias, fatigue, and intentional distortion. Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment.",

In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks.

We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG.

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.",

However, despite rapid advances in machine learning, existing approaches remain crop- or region-specific and require data engineering efforts. This limits scalability, reproducibility, and operational deployment. This study introduces UniCrop, a universal and reusable data pipeline designed to automate the acquisition, cleaning, harmonisation, and engineering of multi-source environmental data for crop yield prediction. For any given location, crop type, and temporal window, UniCrop automatically retrieves, harmonises, and engineers over 200 environmental variables (Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ERA5-Land, NASA POWER, SoilGrids, and SRTM), reducing them to a compact, analysis-ready feature set utilising a structured feature reduction workflow with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). To validate, UniCrop was applied to a rice yield dataset comprising 557 field observations. Using only the selected 15 features, four baseline machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Elastic Net) were trained. LightGBM achieved the best single-model performance (RMSE = 465.1 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6576$), while a constrained ensemble of all baselines further improved accuracy (RMSE = 463.2 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6604$). UniCrop contributes a scalable and transparent data-engineering framework that addresses the primary bottleneck in operational crop yield modelling: the preparation of consistent and harmonised multi-source data. By decoupling data specification from implementation and supporting any crop, region, and time frame through simple configuration updates, UniCrop provides a practical foundation for scalable agricultural analytics.

Synthetic data is generated using StyleGAN2 ADA and incorporated exclusively within the training identities; a post generation filtering step is applied to mitigate identity leakage and remove artifact affected samples. Experimental results across enrollment verification gaps from 6 to 36 months show that synthetic-augmented fine tuning substantially reduces error rates relative to both the pretrained baseline and real only fine tuning.

This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\\mathcal{B}$, $g : \\bar P \\to C^0(\\bar P)$, $\\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} : \\bar P \\to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain.

Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations.

During the inversion process, the conductivity model is iteratively updated using the Gauss Newton method, while the model space is constrained by projections onto the learned VAE decoder. This framework preserves explicit control over data misfit and enables flexible adaptation to different survey configurations.

      "content": "Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification. F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance (AUC=0.999, EER=1.12%) over single-capture baselines (Verifinger, DeepPrint).",

It is one of the essential steps towards character recognition, writer identification, and script-style evolution analysis. The binarization task itself is challenging due to the vast diversity of writing styles, inks, and paper materials. It is even more difficult for historical manuscripts due to the aging and degradation of the documents over time. One of such manuscripts is the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) image collection, which poses extreme challenges for the existing binarization techniques. This article proposes a new binarization technique for the DSS images using the deep encoder-decoder networks. Although the artificial neural network proposed here is primarily designed to binarize the DSS images, it can be trained on different manuscript collections as well. Additionally, the use of transfer learning makes the network already utilizable for a wide range of handwritten documents, making it a unique multi-purpose tool for binarization. Qualitative results and several quantitative comparisons using both historical manuscripts and datasets from handwritten document image binarization competition (H-DIBCO and DIBCO) exhibit the robustness and the effectiveness of the system.

This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores. Finally, we discuss how shelf browsing information could be used for retail planning and in the domain of human-robot interaction scenarios.",

This paper presents a simulation-based study of a complete autonomous subsea object recovery mission using a Hadal Small Vehicle (HSV) equipped with a three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a suction-actuated end effector. The Stonefish simulator is used to model realistic vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamic disturbances, sensing, and interaction with a target object under hadal-like conditions. The control framework combines a world-frame PID controller for vehicle navigation and stabilization with an inverse-kinematics-based manipulator controller augmented by acceleration feed-forward, enabling coordinated vehicle - manipulator operation. In simulation, the HSV autonomously descends from the sea surface to 6,000 m, performs structured seafloor coverage, detects a target object, and executes a suction-based recovery. The results demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation provides an effective and low-risk means of evaluating autonomous deep-sea intervention behaviors prior to field deployment.",

This challenge hinders intuitive human control over complex robotic systems, limiting their educational and practical accessibility. To address this, we present the EduSim-LLM, an educational platform that integrates LLMs with robot simulation and constructs a language-drive control model that translates natural language instructions into executable robot behavior sequences in CoppeliaSim. We design two human-robot interaction models: direct control and autonomous control, conduct systematic simulations based on multiple language models, and evaluate multi-robot collaboration, motion planning, and manipulation capabilities. Experiential results show that LLMs can reliably convert natural language into structured robot actions; after applying prompt-engineering templates instruction-parsing accuracy improves significantly; as task complexity increases, overall accuracy rate exceeds 88.9% in the highest complexity tests.",

Furthermore, stopping at undesired locations rather than designated bus stops creates safety risks and contributes to roadblocks, often causing traffic congestion. Additionally, issues such as blind spots, along with a lack of following traffic laws, increase the chances of accidents. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a smart public bus system along with intelligent bus stops that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Our approach includes a deep learning-based blind-spot warning system to help drivers avoid accidents with automated bus-stop detection to accurately identify bus stops, improving transit efficiency. We also introduce IoT-based solar-powered smart bus stops that show real-time passenger counts, along with an RFID-based card system to track where passengers board and exit. A smart door system ensures safer and more organised boarding, while real-time bus tracking keeps passengers informed. To connect all these features, we use an HTTP-based server for seamless communication between the interconnected network systems. Our proposed system demonstrated approximately 99% efficiency in real-time blind spot detection while stopping precisely at the bus stops. Furthermore, the server showed real-time location updates both to the users and at the bus stops, enhancing commuting efficiency. The proposed energy-efficient bus stop demonstrated 12.71kWh energy saving, promoting sustainable architecture.

We introduce the Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN), which integrates Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) to address the aforementioned limitations. Leveraging a pre-trained keypoint annotation model and a fully convolutional network, AML accurately localizes critical facial parts (e.g., eye and mouth groups) and generates group masks that delineate meaningful feature regions, thereby mitigating negative transfer from global region usage. Furthermore, G2FF combines group and global features to enhance FAR learning, enabling more precise attribute identification. Extensive experiments on two challenging facial attribute recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGMTN in improving FAR performance.",

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \\emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \\textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.",

      "content": "Automatic pronunciation assessment plays a crucial role in computer-assisted pronunciation training systems. Due to the ability to perform multiple pronunciation tasks simultaneously, multi-aspect multi-granularity pronunciation assessment methods are gradually receiving more attention and achieving better performance than single-level modeling tasks. However, existing methods only consider unidirectional dependencies between adjacent granularity levels, lacking bidirectional interaction among phoneme, word, and utterance levels and thus insufficiently capturing the acoustic structural correlations. To address this issue, we propose a novel residual hierarchical interactive method, HIA for short, that enables bidirectional modeling across granularities. As the core of HIA, the Interactive Attention Module leverages an attention mechanism to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction, effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations between different granularity levels. We also propose a residual hierarchical structure to alleviate the feature forgetting problem when modeling acoustic hierarchies. In addition, we use 1-D convolutional layers to enhance the extraction of local contextual cues at each granularity. Extensive experiments on the speechocean762 dataset show that our model is comprehensively ahead of the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (\\beta = 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (\\beta = 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (\\beta = 0.547, p < 0.001).

      "content": "Memory overload is a common form of resource exhaustion in cloud data warehouses. When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision. Experimental results show that SafeLoad achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with low online and offline time overhead. Specifically, SafeLoad improves precision by up to 66% over the best baseline and reduces wasted CPU time by up to 8.09x compared to scenarios without SafeLoad.",

Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and reveal its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both training expense as well as estimation quality.

A potential strategy for improving their aerodynamic efficiency and reducing emissions is through active adaptation of their exterior shapes to the aerodynamic environment. In this study, we present a reduced-scale morphing vehicle prototype capable of actively interacting with the aerodynamic environment to enhance fuel economy. Morphing is accomplished by retrofitting a deformable structure actively actuated by built-in motors. The morphing vehicle prototype is integrated with an optimization algorithm that can autonomously identify the structural shape that minimizes aerodynamic drag. The performance of the morphing vehicle prototype is investigated through an extensive experimental campaign in a large-scale wind tunnel facility. The autonomous optimization algorithm identifies an optimal morphing shape that can elicit an 8.5% reduction in the mean drag force. Our experiments provide a comprehensive dataset that validates the efficiency of shape morphing, demonstrating a clear and consistent decrease in the drag force as the vehicle transitions from a suboptimal to the optimal shape. Insights gained from experiments on scaled-down models provide valuable guidelines for the design of full-size morphing vehicles, which could lead to appreciable energy savings and reductions in GHG emissions. This study highlights the feasibility and benefits of real-time shape morphing under conditions representative of realistic road environments, paving the way for the realization of full-scale morphing vehicles with enhanced aerodynamic efficiency and reduced GHG emissions.",

The proposed system integrates an attention-based convolutional neural network combining EfficientNetV2-B3 with Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanisms for automated ALL cell classification. Our approach employs comprehensive data augmentation, focal loss for class imbalance, and patient-wise data splitting to ensure robust and reproducible evaluation. On the C-NMC 2019 dataset (12,528 original images from 62 patients), the system achieves a 97.89% F1-score and 97.89% accuracy on the test set, with statistical validation through 100-iteration Monte Carlo experiments confirming significant improvements (p < 0.001) over baseline methods. The proposed pipeline outperforms existing approaches by up to 4.67% while using 89% fewer parameters than VGG16 (15.2M vs. 138M). The attention mechanism provides interpretable visualizations of diagnostically relevant cellular features, demonstrating that modern attention-based architectures can improve leukemic cell classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.",

In contrast with classical boosting  Freund and Schapire (1997); Friedman (2001), where the ensemble evolves through first-order additive updates, we study second-order recursive architectures in which each predictor depends on its two immediate predecessors. These Fibonacci flows induce a learning dynamic with memory, allowing ensembles to integrate past structure while adapting to new residual information. We introduce a general family of recursive weight-update algorithms encompassing Fibonacci, tribonacci, and higher-order recursions, together with continuous-time limits that yield systems of differential equations governing ensemble evolution. We establish global convergence conditions, spectral stability criteria, and non-asymptotic generalization bounds under Rademacher Bartlett and Mendelson (2002) and algorithmic stability analyses. The resulting theory unifies recursive ensembles, structured weighting, and dynamical systems viewpoints in statistical learning. Experiments with kernel ridge regression Rasmussen and Williams (2006), spline smoothers Wahba (1990), and random Fourier feature models Rahimi and Recht (2007) demonstrate that recursive flows consistently improve approximation and generalization beyond static weighting. These results complete the trilogy begun in Papers I and II: from Fibonacci weighting, through geometric weighting theory, to fully dynamical recursive ensemble learning systems.",

Development of such algorithms and models typically involves a formal evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness and progress beyond the state-of-the-art. Ideally, a thorough evaluation should cover many diverse application scenarios and room-acoustic conditions. However, in practice, evaluation datasets are often limited in size and diversity because they rely on costly and time-consuming measurements. This paper explores how room-acoustic simulations can be used for evaluating ASP/AML algorithms. To this end, we evaluate three ASP/AML algorithms with room-acoustic measurements and data from different simulation engines, and assess the match between the evaluation results obtained from measurements and simulations. The presented investigation compares a numerical wave-based solver with two geometrical acoustics simulators. While numerical wave-based simulations yielded similar evaluation results as measurements for all three evaluated ASP/AML algorithms, geometrical acoustic simulations could not replicate the measured evaluation results as reliably.",

Shrimp farming represents a significant source of income in many regions; however, like other forms of aquaculture, it is severely impacted by disease outbreaks. These diseases pose a major challenge to sustainable shrimp production. To address this issue, automated disease classification methods can offer timely and accurate detection. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach for the automated classification of shrimp diseases. A dataset comprising 1,149 images across four disease classes was utilized. Six pretrained deep learning models, ResNet50, EfficientNet, DenseNet201, MobileNet, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Xception were deployed and evaluated for performance. The images background was removed, followed by standardized preprocessing through the Keras image pipeline. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) was used for enhancing the model robustness through adversarial training. While advanced augmentation strategies, including CutMix and MixUp, were implemented to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. To support interpretability, and to visualize regions of model attention, post-hoc explanation methods such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and XGrad-CAM were applied. Exploratory results demonstrated that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest performance, attaining a 96.88% accuracy on the test dataset. After 1000 iterations, the 99% confidence interval for the model is [0.953,0.971].",

This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.",

To address the lack of a consistent interpretation across tools, we implement a Unified Compliance Aggregator (UCA) that parses tool outputs, normalizes scores to a common 0--100 scale, and combines them into a weighted metric augmented by a customizable rule engine for organization-specific security policies. Experimental results show that full hardening increases OpenSCAP compliance from 39.7 to 71.8, while custom rule compliance improves from 39.3\\% to 83.6\\%.

Traditional knowledge representation models often suffer from a gap between static symbolic logic and dynamic system execution. To bridge this divide, KOS-TL leverages Dependent Type Theory to unify data, logic, and proof into a singular computational substrate.The architecture of KOS-TL is organized into three hierarchical layers: the Core Layer, which defines the static type universe and constructive primitives; the Kernel Layer, which governs state evolution through an event-driven mechanism characterized by the triple $\\langle \\Sigma, \\textsf{Ev}, \\Delta \\rangle$; and the Runtime Layer, responsible for the bidirectional refinement of physical signals into logical evidence. We formally define the operational semantics of the system and prove key meta-theoretical properties, including Progress and Evolutionary Consistency, ensuring that the system remains logically self-consistent and free from stuck states during continuous state transitions.By integrating Davidsonian event semantics with Martin-L\\\"of type theory, KOS-TL enables the construction of \"proof-carrying knowledge,\" where every state change in the knowledge base is accompanied by a formal witness of its validity. We demonstrate the practical utility of this logic through application examples in industrial traceability and cross-border financial compliance.

The research questions are: (1) How does interactive robot-empowered scenario learning influence the learning engagement and motivation of NAS in learning Cantonese? and (2) What is the impact of a robot-empowered scenario learning system on the Cantonese language proficiency of NAS? Fourteen children are invited to participate in a four-day learning program with Boon Boon.

      "content": "This research aims to develop a novel deep learning network, GBU-Net, utilizing a group-batch-normalized U-Net framework, specifically designed for the precise semantic segmentation of the left ventricle in short-axis cine MRI scans. The methodology includes a down-sampling pathway for feature extraction and an up-sampling pathway for detail restoration, enhanced for medical imaging. Key modifications include techniques for better contextual understanding crucial in cardiac MRI segmentation. The dataset consists of 805 left ventricular MRI scans from 45 patients, with comparative analysis using established metrics such as the dice coefficient and mean perpendicular distance. GBU-Net significantly improves the accuracy of left ventricle segmentation in cine MRI scans. Its innovative design outperforms existing methods in tests, surpassing standard metrics like the dice coefficient and mean perpendicular distance. The approach is unique in its ability to capture contextual information, often missed in traditional CNN-based segmentation. An ensemble of the GBU-Net attains a 97% dice score on the SunnyBrook testing dataset. GBU-Net offers enhanced precision and contextual understanding in left ventricle segmentation for surgical robotics and medical analysis.",

      "content": "Face recognition for infants and toddlers presents unique challenges due to rapid facial morphology changes, high inter-class similarity, and limited dataset availability. This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.",

This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures.",

      "content": "We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.   We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.",

In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts.

The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations.

      "content": "Computer vision (CV), a non-intrusive and cost-effective technology, has furthered the development of precision livestock farming by enabling optimized decision-making through timely and individualized animal care. The availability of affordable two- and three-dimensional camera sensors, combined with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has provided a valuable opportunity to improve livestock production systems. However, despite the availability of various CV tools in the public domain, applying these tools to animal data can be challenging, often requiring users to have programming and data analysis skills, as well as access to computing resources. Moreover, the rapid expansion of precision livestock farming is creating a growing need to educate and train animal science students in CV. This presents educators with the challenge of efficiently demonstrating the complex algorithms involved in CV. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop ShinyAnimalCV, an open-source cloud-based web application. This application provides a user-friendly interface for performing CV tasks, including object segmentation, detection, three-dimensional surface visualization, and extraction of two- and three-dimensional morphological features. Nine pre-trained CV models using top-view animal data are included in the application. ShinyAnimalCV has been deployed online using cloud computing platforms. The source code of ShinyAnimalCV is available on GitHub, along with detailed documentation on training CV models using custom data and deploying ShinyAnimalCV locally to allow users to fully leverage the capabilities of the application. ShinyAnimalCV can contribute to CV research and teaching in the animal science community.",

      "content": "Context: The city of Kinshasa faces severe traffic congestion, requiring strategic infrastructure capacity enhancements. Although a comprehensive master plan has been proposed, its implementation requires substantial financial investment, which remains constrained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an emerging economy. This research proposes a traffic flow based algorithm to support the development of priority road segments. The objective is to enable more effective prioritisation of road construction projects and facilitate the optimal allocation of limited infrastructure budgets.   Methods: The study was conducted by formulating a standard transport network design problem (TNDP) that included estimated origin demand data specific to the city of Kinshasa. Given the high computational nature of the 30 node network design, TNDP relevant metaheuristics (GA, ACO, PSO, SA, TS, Greedy) were used selectively and hybridised to achieve high quality, stable solutions. A greedy search seeded simulated annealing and Tabu search were devised to achieve the design goals.   Results: Greedy Simulated Annealing and Greedy Tabu search yielded the best travel time reduction and the most stable solutions compared to other solvers, also improving network edge betweenness centrality by nearly a scale of two and a half.   Conclusions: Road priorities were proposed, including junctions connecting the Bandundu and Kongo Central entry point to main attraction centres (Limete Poids Lourd, Gombe, Airport) and additional inner city areas (Ngaliema, Selembao, Lemba, Masina, Kimwenza).",

      "content": "We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.",

While previous studies have examined isolated aspects of inequality, there is limited research that integrates both statistical analysis and advanced machine learning to uncover hidden structures within population data. This study leverages statistical analysis ($\\chi^2$ test of independence and Two Proportion Z-Test) and machine learning clustering techniques -- K-Modes and K-Prototypes -- along with t-SNE visualization and CatBoost classification to analyze socioeconomic integration and inequality. Using statistical tests, we identified the proportion of the population with healthcare insurance, quality education, and employment. With this data, we concluded that there was an association between employment and citizenship status. Moreover, we were able to determine 5 distinct population groups using Machine Learning classification. The five clusters our analysis identifies reveal that while citizenship status shows no association with workforce participation, significant disparities exist in access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Each cluster represents a distinct demographic of the population, showing that there is a primary split along the lines of educational attainment which separates Clusters 0 and 4 from Clusters 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, labor force status and nativity serve as secondary differentiators. Non-citizens are also disproportionately concentrated in precarious employment without benefits, highlighting systemic inequalities in healthcare access. By uncovering demographic clusters that face compounded disadvantages, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of socioeconomic stratification.",

      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms.",

The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes.

      "content": "Ball Mapper is an widely used tool in topological data analysis for summarizing the structure of high-dimensional data through metric-based coverings and graph representations. A central computational bottleneck in Ball Mapper is the construction of the underlying cover, which requires repeated range queries to identify data points within a fixed distance of selected landmarks. As data sets grow in size and dimensionality, naive implementations of this step become increasingly inefficient.   In this work, we study practical strategies for accelerating cover construction in Ball Mapper by improving the efficiency of range queries. We integrate two complementary approaches into the Ball Mapper pipeline: hierarchical geometric pruning using ball tree data structures, and hardware-aware distance computation using Facebook AI Similarity Search. We describe the underlying algorithms, discuss their trade-offs with respect to metric flexibility and dimensionality, and provide implementation details relevant to large-scale data analysis.   Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that both approaches yield substantial speedups over the baseline implementation, with performance gains depending on data set size, dimensionality, and choice of distance function. These results improve the practical scalability of Ball Mapper without modifying its theoretical formulation and provide guidance for the efficient implementation of metric-based exploratory tools in modern data analysis workflows.",

Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet. The results show that LUMPNet achieves superior performance.",

      "content": "Computer vision provides automated, non-invasive, and scalable tools for monitoring dairy cattle, thereby supporting management, health assessment, and phenotypic data collection. Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.",

Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background. Based on geometrical properties of ship and some concepts such as brightness distortion, a new method for backwash cancellation is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and methods have outstanding performance in ship detection and tracking.

      "content": "We propose a theoretical framework--Holographic Reservoir Computing (HRC)--which hypothesizes that the thermodynamic noise and timing dynamics in voltage-stressed Bitcoin mining ASICs (BM1366) could potentially serve as a physical reservoir computing substrate. We present the CHIMERA (Conscious Hybrid Intelligence via Miner-Embedded Resonance Architecture) system architecture, which treats the SHA-256 hashing pipeline not as an entropy source, but as a deterministic diffusion operator whose timing characteristics under controlled voltage and frequency conditions may exhibit computationally useful dynamics. We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the \"Silicon Heartbeat\" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies. However, we emphasize that these are theoretical projections requiring experimental validation. We present the implemented measurement infrastructure, acknowledge current limitations, and outline the experimental program necessary to confirm or refute these hypotheses. This work contributes to the emerging field of thermodynamic computing by proposing a novel approach to repurposing obsolete cryptographic hardware for neuromorphic applications.",

      "content": "This paper employs a data-driven approach to determine the impact of concrete mixture compositions on the temporal evolution of chloride in concrete structures. This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure.",

      "content": "The textile industry in Bangladesh is one of the most energy-intensive sectors, yet its monitoring practices remain largely outdated, resulting in inefficient power usage and high operational costs. To address this, we propose a real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)-based framework tailored for industrial applications, with a focus on identical motor-driven loads representing textile cutting machines. A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of NILM in industrial contexts, offering insights into future improvements such as higher-frequency data collection, larger-scale datasets and advanced deep learning approaches for handling identical loads.",

It says we should maximize welfare, whatever that takes.Liberalism says: “to each their own sphere of freedom”. We should grant everyone some boundary that others can’t violate, for example over their physical bodies and their property, and then let whatever happen as long as those boundaries aren’t violated.(Before the philosophers show up and cancel me: “utilitarianism” and “liberalism” here are labels for two views, that correspond somewhat but not exactly to the normal uses of the phrases. The particular axis I talk about comes from my reading of Joe Carlsmith, who I’ll quote at length later in this post. Also, for the Americans: “liberalism” is not a synonym for “left-wing”.)Some of the great moral advances of modernity are:women’s rightsabolition of slaveryequality before the law for all citizens of a countrywar as an aberration to be avoided, rather than an “extension of politics by other means”gay rightsthe increasing salience of animal welfareEvery one of these can be seen as either a fundamentally utilitarian or fundamentally liberal project. For example, viewing wars of aggression as bad is both good for welfare (fewer people dying horrible deaths way too early), and a straightforward consequence of believing that “your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins” (either on a personal or national level).

This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical benefits justify the effort.",

A Bayesian negative binomial regression is applied, with days on chart as the outcome and collaboration status (solo versus multi-artist) and log total streams as predictors. This approach is well suited for overdispersed count data and allows the effect of collaboration to be interpreted while controlling for overall popularity. Posterior inference is conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and results are assessed using rate ratios, posterior probabilities, and predictive checks.
