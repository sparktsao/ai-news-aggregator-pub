      "content": "✨ After many years, I finally got multi characters working on Photo AI now  🥳🥳🥳\n\nYou can now train and then select up to 4 multiple characters (by holding [ ⇧ Shift ] or long pressing on mobile) and they will be generated all together in a single photo\n\nThis makes Photo AI much more interesting as a product now because most photos are not of a single person, but of couples, or groups like families (think how much group family photographers charge etc)\n\nThis was the #1 most requested feature for years and was never possible because with both Stable Diffusion and Flux, I'd train a LoRa on one character (person), and if I combined multiple LoRas, instead of generating both people it would merge the two people's likeness into one, so absolutely useless. For a long time I tried to think of other ways, like generating one image first with multiple people, then replacing those people with each LoRa with img2img, but it was all too unwieldy and didn't really work well\n\nCouples kinda worked if you'd train a new model with photos of both of you, but every photo had to kinda have the same position like (you left, partner right) or it'd start messing it up, TL;DR the models were too dumb to do this\n\nBut with all the new models now like Nano Banana Pro and Hyper Realism, they're finally smart enough to understand what you want to generate\n\nThe results are very detailed and you can do stuff like \n1) extreme close ups with cool lights (AI Photography pack)\n2) put you and your gf in Berghain (Berlin photo pack)\n3) turn you guys into digital nomads in Bangkok (digital nomad pack)\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER 😊",

      "content": "**Navigation World Models** by @ylecun and his colleagues. This CVPR 2025 Best Paper Honorable Mention paper extends the \"thinking\" concept we are used to in LLMs to robot movement planning.\n\nThe authors train what they call a \"world model\"—a neural network that takes the current camera view and a movement command (like \"go forward and turn left\"), then predicts what the camera will see afterward.\n\nThe model uses diffusion, a technique where you train a network to gradually remove noise from images, which turns out to work well for generating realistic future views. \n\nThe interesting part is how they use this for planning: instead of learning a fixed policy that says \"given this goal, take this action,\" the model simulates many possible movement sequences, checks which one ends up looking most like the goal image, and picks that path. \n\nThis means you can add constraints at test time (like \"don't turn left\") without retraining. They also show that training on random human walking videos from the internet helps the model generalize to new environments it has never seen, even though those videos have no robot action labels—the model just learns visual priors about how indoor and outdoor scenes look when you walk through them.\n\nRead online and ask clarifying questions while reading: https://t.co/mH74YbUrSl\n\nDownload the PDF: https://t.co/EEYrsMWnzK",

No warning. It just returned garbage.\n\nHere is the harsh truth:\n\nAgents fail a lot. And they fail silently. All the time. You just can't trust an LLM to do the right thing every time.\n\nBy now, I've built and deployed a couple of dozen agents, and here are some of the things that actually work:\n\n1. Observability from day one. If you can't see what your agent is doing, you can't debug it, improve it, or trust it. Every agent should produce traces showing the full request flow, model interactions, token usage, and timing metadata.\n\n2. Guardrails on inputs and outputs. Everything that goes into and comes out of an LLM should be checked by deterministic code. Even things that aren't likely to break will eventually break.\n\n3. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. You can build a simple judge using an LLM to automatically evaluate your agent's outputs. Label a dataset, write the evaluation prompt, and iterate until your judge catches most failures.\n\n4. Error analysis. You can collect failure samples, categorize them, and diagnose the most frequent mistakes.\n\n5. Context engineering. Often, agents fail because their context is noisy, overloaded, or irrelevant. Learning how to keep context relevant is huge.\n\n6. Human feedback loops.

But here are some of my very general thoughts:\n\n1. A major disruption is coming, but we don't know how ill it play out. I am betting that what comes on the other side will be largely (and enormously) positive. If it were anything else, then all planing is futile in the end.\n\n2. While what awaits us might be extremely beneficial, the transition could be extremely unsettling and chaotic. Try to be as prepared on every level you can for it. Put your affairs in order. Have enough basic resources that could last you a few years. \n\n3. I don't believe that investing into any kind of skills, \"marketable\" or \"unmarketable\" will make that much of a difference for the vast majority of people. That's why I am pretty relaxed about my children's education.\n\n4. I hope to be able to support my children *directly* and *personally* as much as possible though most of their lives. That's one of the reasons why I moved to a relatively affordable area, where I hope my children could also settle. \n\n5. In terms of investment (and this is NOT an investment advice), I am largely betting on things that will directly benefit from the technological revolution and things that have stood the test of time. I don't want to be any more specific than that. ;)",

You're literally one hallucination away from a disaster.\n\nThe guys behind Parlant are doing something really smart with their new version: You can build an agent with the best of both worlds.\n\nThe agent can dynamically switch between an LLM agent and strict mode based on what's happening in the conversation.\n\nRisk isn't uniform across a conversation:\n\n1. When a customer asks a casual product question, Parlant engages the LLM to generate a fluid and helpful answer.\n\n2. When a customer asks for a refund, Parlant engages strict mode to only return approved, contextually-driven response templates.\n\nYou control the agent's \"composition mode\" based on natural-language observations about the current state of the conversation.\n\nThis is a really cool idea. It should significantly improve the current state of the art in chatbots.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://t.co/iaSQPf4fku\n\nThe attached diagram shows how the dynamic composition mode works.",
