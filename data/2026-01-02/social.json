      "content": "Every so often @G_S_Bhogal puts together a list of interesting ideas. His latest: https://t.co/nUtB4SPJUE\n\nFor 2026, I asked Gemini 3 Pro to do the same. Here is Gemini’s verbatim: \n\n1. The Promethean Gap\nWe are currently living in what philosopher Günther Anders called the Promethean Gap: the widening disparity between our capacity to create technology and our capacity to imagine its consequences. In 2026, as AI agents begin to act autonomously, we will produce effects we cannot emotionally or morally comprehend. The tool has outpaced the user’s conscience.\n\n2. Jevons Paradox\nAs AI makes intelligence and content creation cheaper and more efficient, we will not use less of it; we will use exponentially more. Expect an explosion of demand for compute and energy, not a reduction. Efficiency does not lead to conservation; it leads to consumption.\n\n3. Audience Capture\nThe digital trap where creators are slowly reshaped by the feedback loops of their followers. To maintain engagement, they become caricatures of themselves, adopting extreme views they don't actually hold because that is what the algorithm (and the audience) rewards. In 2026, entire political movements are victims of audience capture.\n\n4. Epistemic Trespassing\nA growing annoyance where experts in one field (like computer science) confidently assert authority in another (like biology or geopolitics) without realizing their competence doesn't transfer. As polymaths vanish, trespassers rise.\n\n5. Hyperstition\nA portmanteau of \"hype\" and \"superstition.\" It is a fiction that makes itself true. The classic example is a run on a bank; the modern example is a meme coin or a political narrative. If enough people believe a fake scenario is real, they act in ways that bring it about. We are now manufacturing our own reality.\n\n6. The Shirky Principle\n\"Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.\" As AI threatens to solve complex problems (like translation or basic legal work), watch old institutions fight to keep the problems alive to justify their existence.\n\n7. Gall’s Law\n\"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.\" You cannot build a complex AI-integrated society from scratch. It must grow from functioning, simple roots. Attempts to engineer a perfect complex system instantly (like a new smart city or government) always fail.\n\n8. The Tocqueville Paradox\nAs living standards improve, people’s tolerance for remaining dissatisfactions decreases. The better things get, the angrier we feel about what is still wrong. This explains why 2026 might feel like a time of crisis despite objective metrics of abundance.\n\n9. Constructal Law\nA physics principle stating that for a flow system (like a river, a tree, or society) to persist, it must evolve to provide easier access to the currents that flow through it. Society is reorganizing itself not for fairness or happiness, but to maximize the flow of information and energy.\n\n10. Ergodicity\nThe difference between the group average and the individual experience. If 100 people play Russian Roulette, the \"group average\" survival rate is 98.3%. But if one person plays it 100 times, the survival rate is 0%. Do not confuse the safety of the collective with your safety as an individual.\n\n11. Legibility\nA concept from James C. Scott. States and algorithms want to make complex, messy human lives \"legible\"—easy to measure, tax, and categorize. But in the process of tidying up the mess (standardizing education, farming, or speech), they often destroy the hidden ecosystem that made it work in the first place.\n\n12. The Semmelweis Reflex\nThe knee-jerk tendency to reject new evidence because it contradicts established norms. Named after Ignaz Semmelweis, who was ridiculed for suggesting doctors wash their hands. In 2026, the \"crazy\" ideas about health or tech that experts mock may be the ones that save you.",

      "content": "13. Mimetic Desire\nYou don’t want things because you want them; you want them because other people want them. Social media is a machine for accelerating mimetic desire, creating bubbles of envy for things (like specific careers or lifestyles) that have no intrinsic value to you.\n\n14. Brandolini’s Law\nAlso known as the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle: The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than is needed to produce it. With generative AI, the cost of producing bullshit has dropped to zero. We are drowning in asymmetry.\n\n15. The Cobra Effect\nWhen an attempted solution makes the problem worse due to perverse incentives. (The British offered a bounty for dead cobras in Delhi; people started breeding cobras to collect the bounty). Watch for policies in 2026 that incentivize the exact behavior they try to ban (like \"hate speech\" laws creating more trolls).\n\n16. Chesterton’s Fence\nDo not remove a fence until you know why it was put there. As we rush to \"disrupt\" industries and traditions with AI, we are tearing down fences (social norms, institutions) without understanding the protection they provided against chaos.\n\n17. The Lindy Effect\nThe future life expectancy of a non-perishable thing (like a book or an idea) is proportional to its current age. The Bible will outlast the latest self-help bestseller. To survive 2026, bet on things that have already survived 2,000 years, not 2 years.\n\n18. Predictive Processing\nYour brain does not see the world; it hallucinates a prediction of the world and corrects it only when there is an error. We are trapped in our own controlled hallucinations. Understanding this helps you realize that your \"reality\" is just a best-guess simulation.\n\n19. Egregores\nAn occult term for a \"collective group mind.\" When a corporation, a subreddit, or a political party takes on a life of its own, acting in ways no single member intended, it has become an Egregore. You are not fighting people; you are fighting autonomous psychic entities.\n\n20. Sayre’s Law\n\"In any dispute, the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake.\" This is why Twitter (X) arguments are so vicious—because the stakes are so low.\n\n21. Hormesis\nThe biological phenomenon where a beneficial effect results from a low dose of an agent that is otherwise toxic. Stress, cold, and hunger (in small doses) make you stronger. Comfort is a slow poison; managed volatility is the cure.\n\n22. Goodhart’s Law\n\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\" If you measure AI by how human it sounds, it will learn to lie like a human. If you measure success by likes, you get clickbait. All metrics in 2026 are compromised.\n\n23. The Moloch Trap\nA game-theoretic situation where individual incentives force everyone to sacrifice value, even though everyone would be better off if they coordinated. (e.g., beauty filters: everyone uses them to compete, so nobody looks better relative to others, but everyone feels uglier). We are sacrificing our humanity to Moloch.\n\n24. Shifting Baseline Syndrome\nEach generation accepts the state of the world they were born into as \"normal.\" We don't realize how much silence, nature, or privacy we've lost because our baseline keeps resetting downward.\n\n25. Paradox of Tolerance\nIf a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. To maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance. The battle of 2026 will be defining who \"the intolerant\" are.\n\n26. Wu Wei\nThe Taoist concept of \"inexertion\" or \"effortless action.\" In a world of infinite AI noise and \"grindset\" hustle, the most effective action is often to do nothing—to wait, watch, and let the mud settle until the water is clear. Force creates resistance; flow creates victory.",

Liberals started publishing the cutting-edge research for vanity.\n\nThe Chinese, being poor but well-educated and more hardworking, first learned to copy.
