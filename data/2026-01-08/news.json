      "title": "TII Abu-Dhabi Released Falcon H1R-7B: A New Reasoning Model Outperforming Others in Math and Coding with only 7B Params with 256k Context Window",
      "content": "Technology Innovation Institute (TII), Abu Dhabi, has released Falcon-H1R-7B, a 7B parameter reasoning specialized model that matches or exceeds many 14B to 47B reasoning models in math, code and general benchmarks, while staying compact and efficient. It builds on Falcon H1 7B Base and is available on Hugging Face under the Falcon-H1R collection.\n\n\n\nFalcon-H1R-7B is interesting because it combines 3 design choices in 1 system, a hybrid Transformer along with Mamba2 backbone, a very long context that reaches 256k tokens in standard vLLM deployments, and a training recipe that mixes supervised long form reasoning with reinforcement learning using GRPO.\n\n\n\nHybrid Transformer plus Mamba2 architecture with long context\n\n\n\nFalcon-H1R-7B is a causal decoder only model with a hybrid architecture that combines Transformer layers and Mamba2 state space components. The Transformer blocks provide standard attention based reasoning, while the Mamba2 blocks give linear time sequence modeling and better memory scaling as context length grows. This design targets the 3 axes of reasoning efficiency that the team describes, speed, token efficiency and accuracy. \n\n\n\nThe model runs with a default --max-model-len of 262144 when served through vLLM, which corresponds to a practical 256k token context window. This allows very long chain of thought traces, multi step tool use logs and large multi document prompts in a single pass. The hybrid backbone helps control memory use at these sequence lengths and improves throughput compared with a pure Transformer 7B baseline on the same hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining recipe for reasoning tasks\n\n\n\nFalcon H1R 7B uses a 2 stage training pipeline:\n\n\n\nIn the first stage, the team runs cold start supervised fine tuning on top of Falcon-H1-7B Base. The SFT (supervised fine tuning) data mixes step by step long form reasoning traces in 3 main domains, mathematics, coding and science, plus non reasoning domains such as chat, tool calling and safety. Difficulty aware filtering upweights harder problems and downweights trivial ones. Targets can reach up to 48k tokens, so the model sees long derivations and full solution paths during training.\n\n\n\nIn the second stage, the SFT checkpoint is refined with GRPO, which is a group relative policy optimization method for reinforcement learning. Rewards are given when the generated reasoning chain is verifiably correct. For math problems, the system uses symbolic checks on the final answer. For code, it executes the generated program against unit tests. This RL stage pushes the model to keep useful intermediate steps while staying within a token budget. \n\n\n\nThe result is a 7B model that is tuned specifically for chain of thought reasoning, rather than general chat.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks in math, coding and general reasoning\n\n\n\nThe Falcon-H1R-7B benchmark scores are grouped across math, code and agentic tasks, and general reasoning tasks.\n\n\n\nIn the math group, Falcon-H1R-7B reaches an aggregate score of 73.96%, ahead of Apriel-1.5-15B at 69.32% and larger models like Qwen3-32B and Nemotron-H-47B. On individual benchmarks:\n\n\n\n\nAIME 24, 88.1%, higher than Apriel-1.5-15B at 86.2%\n\n\n\nAIME 25, 83.1%, higher than Apriel-1.5-15B at 80%\n\n\n\nHMMT 25, 64.9%, above all listed baselines\n\n\n\nAMO Bench, 36.3%, compared with 23.3% for DeepSeek-R1-0528 Qwen3-8B \n\n\n\n\nFor code and agentic workloads, the model reaches 33.95% as a group score. On LiveCodeBench v6, Falcon-H1R-7B scores 68.6%, which is higher than Qwen3-32B and other baselines. It also scores 28.3% on the SciCode sub problem benchmark and 4.9% on Terminal Bench Hard, where it ranks second behind Apriel 1.5-15B but ahead of several 8B and 32B systems.\n\n\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/blog/tiiuae/falcon-h1r-7b\n\n\nOn general reasoning, Falcon-H1R-7B achieves 49.48% as a group score. It records 61.3% on GPQA D, close to other 8B models, 72.1% on MMLU Pro, which is higher than all other 8B models in the above table, 11.1% on HLE and 53.4% on IFBench, where it is second only to Apriel 1.5 15B. \n\n\n\nThe key takeaway is that a 7B model can sit in the same performance band as many 14B to 47B reasoning models, if the architecture and training pipeline are tuned for reasoning tasks.\n\n\n\nInference throughput and test time scaling\n\n\n\nThe team also benchmarked Falcon-H1R-7B on throughput and test time scaling under realistic batch settings.\n\n\n\nFor a 512 token input and 32k token output, Falcon-H1R-7B reaches about 1,000 tokens per second per GPU at batch size 32 and about 1,500 tokens per second per GPU at batch size 64, nearly double the throughput of Qwen3-8B in the same configuration. For an 8k input and 16k output, Falcon-H1R-7B reaches around 1,800 tokens per second per GPU, while Qwen3-8B stays below 900. The hybrid Transformer along with Mamba architecture is a key factor in this scaling behavior, because it reduces the quadratic cost of attention for long sequences. \n\n\n\nFalcon-H1R-7B is also designed for test time scaling using Deep Think with confidence, known as DeepConf. The idea is to run many chains of thought in parallel, then use the model\u2019s own next token confidence scores to filter noisy traces and keep only high quality candidates. \n\n\n\nOn AIME 24 and AIME 25, Falcon-H1R-7B reaches 96.7% accuracy with fewer than 100 million generated tokens, which puts it on a favorable Pareto frontier of accuracy versus token cost compared with other 8B, 14B and 32B reasoning models. On the parser verifiable subset of AMO Bench, it reaches 35.9% accuracy with 217 million tokens, again ahead of the comparison models at similar or larger scale. \n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nFalcon-H1R-7B is a 7B parameter reasoning model that uses a hybrid Transformer along with Mamba2 architecture and supports a 256k token context for long chain of thought prompts.\n\n\n\nThe model is trained in 2 stages, supervised fine tuning on long reasoning traces in math, code and science up to 48k tokens, followed by GRPO based reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for math and code.\n\n\n\nFalcon-H1R-7B achieves strong math performance, including about 88.1% on AIME 24, 83.1% on AIME 25 and a 73.96% aggregate math score, which is competitive with or better than larger 14B to 47B models.\n\n\n\nOn coding and agentic tasks, Falcon-H1R-7B obtains 33.95% as a group score and 68.6% on LiveCodeBench v6, and it is also competitive on general reasoning benchmarks such as MMLU Pro and GPQA D.\n\n\n\nThe hybrid design improves throughput, reaching around 1,000 to 1,800 tokens per second per GPU in the reported settings, and the model supports test time scaling through Deep Think with confidence to improve accuracy using multiple reasoning samples under a controlled token budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the\u00a0Technical details and MODEL WEIGHTS here.\u00a0Also,\u00a0feel free to follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and don\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0100k+ ML SubReddit\u00a0and Subscribe to\u00a0our Newsletter.

      "title": "Nous Research's NousCoder-14B is an open-source coding model landing right in the Claude Code moment",
      "content": "Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems \u2014 trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia&#x27;s latest B200 graphics processors.The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year&#x27;s Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving \u2014 and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSlNousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release.&quot;I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,&quot; wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing \u2014 a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap \u2014 and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability.How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicateWhat distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness \u2014 built on the company&#x27;s Atropos framework \u2014 enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.&quot;Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,&quot; noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t\u2014 from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 \u2014 mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.&quot;Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,&quot; Li wrote in the technical report.But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners.Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problemsNousCoder-14B&#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.The approach relies on what researchers call &quot;verifiable rewards&quot; \u2014 a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints \u2014 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves &quot;dynamic sampling&quot; \u2014 discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.The researchers also adopted &quot;iterative context extension,&quot; first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification \u2014 as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters.The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progressBuried in Li&#x27;s technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses &quot;a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.&quot;In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.&quot;The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,&quot; Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. &quot;This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.&quot;This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is &quot;increasingly finite,&quot; as Li put it.&quot;It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,&quot; he concluded.The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t \u2014 making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. &quot;Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,&quot; he wrote.A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big TechNous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source releases that compete with \u2014 and sometimes exceed \u2014 proprietary alternatives.The company raised $50 million in April 2025 in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its Psyche platform.Previous releases include Hermes 4, a family of models that we reported &quot;outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions,&quot; and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first &quot;toggle-on reasoning model&quot; \u2014 allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand.The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. &quot;Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,&quot; wrote one critic on X, referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance.Others raised technical questions. &quot;Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better,&quot; noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models. Another asked whether NousCoder-14B is &quot;agentic focused or just &#x27;one shot&#x27; coding&quot; \u2014 a distinction that matters for practical software development, where iterating on feedback typically produces better results than single attempts.What researchers say must happen next for AI coding tools to keep improvingThe release includes several directions for future work that hint at where AI coding research may be heading.Multi-turn reinforcement learning tops the list. Currently, the model receives only a final binary reward \u2014 pass or fail \u2014 after generating a solution. But competitive programming problems typically include public test cases that provide intermediate feedback: compilation errors, incorrect outputs, time limit violations. Training models to incorporate this feedback across multiple attempts could significantly improve performance.Controlling response length also remains a challenge. The researchers found that incorrect solutions tended to be longer than correct ones, and response lengths quickly saturated available context windows during training \u2014 a pattern that various algorithmic modifications failed to resolve.Perhaps most ambitiously, Li proposed &quot;problem generation and self-play&quot; \u2014 training models to both solve and create programming problems. This would address the data scarcity problem directly by enabling models to generate their own training curricula.&quot;Humans are great at generating interesting and useful problems for other competitive programmers, but it appears that there still exists a significant gap in LLM capabilities in creative problem generation,&quot; Li wrote.The model is available now on Hugging Face under an Apache 2.0 license. For researchers and developers who want to build on the work, Nous Research has published the complete Atropos training stack alongside it.What took Li two years of adolescent dedication to achieve\u2014climbing from a 1600-level novice to a 2100-rated competitor on Codeforces\u2014an AI replicated in 96 hours. He needed 1,000 problems. The model needed 24,000. But soon enough, these systems may learn to write their own problems, teach themselves, and leave human benchmarks behind entirely.The question is no longer whether machines can learn to code. It&#x27;s whether they&#x27;ll soon be better teachers than we ever were.\n",

      "title": "NVIDIA AI Released Nemotron Speech ASR: A New Open Source Transcription Model Designed from the Ground Up for Low-Latency Use Cases like Voice Agents",
      "content": "NVIDIA has just released its new streaming English transcription model (Nemotron Speech ASR) built specifically for low latency voice agents and live captioning. The checkpoint nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b on Hugging Face combines a cache aware FastConformer encoder with an RNNT decoder, and is tuned for both streaming and batch workloads on modern NVIDIA GPUs. \n\n\n\nModel design, architecture and input assumptions\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) is a 600M parameter model based on a cache aware FastConformer encoder with 24 layers and an RNNT decoder. The encoder uses aggressive 8x convolutional downsampling to reduce the number of time steps, which directly lowers compute and memory costs for streaming workloads. The model consumes 16 kHz mono audio and requires at least 80 ms of input audio per chunk. \n\n\n\nRuntime latency is controlled through configurable context sizes. The model exposes 4 standard chunk configurations, corresponding to about 80 ms, 160 ms, 560 ms and 1.12 s of audio. These modes are driven by the att_context_size parameter, which sets left and right attention context in multiples of 80 ms frames, and can be changed at inference time without retraining. \n\n\n\nCache aware streaming, not buffered sliding windows\n\n\n\nTraditional &#8216;streaming ASR&#8217; often uses overlapping windows. Each incoming window reprocesses part of the previous audio to maintain context, which wastes compute and causes latency to drift upward as concurrency increases.\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR instead keeps a cache of encoder states for all self attention and convolution layers. Each new chunk is processed once, with the model reusing cached activations rather than recomputing overlapping context. This gives:\n\n\n\n\nNon overlapping frame processing, so work scales linearly with audio length\n\n\n\nPredictable memory growth, because cache size grows with sequence length rather than concurrency related duplication\n\n\n\nStable latency under load, which is critical for turn taking and interruption in voice agents\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy vs latency: WER under streaming constraints\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR is evaluated on the Hugging Face OpenASR leaderboard datasets, including AMI, Earnings22, Gigaspeech and LibriSpeech. Accuracy is reported as word error rate (WER) for different chunk sizes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an average across these benchmarks, the model achieves:\n\n\n\n\nAbout 7.84 percent WER at 0.16 s chunk size\n\n\n\nAbout 7.22 percent WER at 0.56 s chunk size\n\n\n\nAbout 7.16 percent WER at 1.12 s chunk size \n\n\n\n\nThis illustrates the latency accuracy tradeoff. Larger chunks give more phonetic context and slightly lower WER, but even the 0.16 s mode keeps WER under 8 percent while remaining usable for real time agents. Developers can choose the operating point at inference time depending on application needs, for example 160 ms for aggressive voice agents, or 560 ms for transcription centric workflows. \n\n\n\nThroughput and concurrency on modern GPUs\n\n\n\nThe cache aware design has measurable impact on concurrency. On an NVIDIA H100 GPU, Nemotron Speech ASR supports about 560 concurrent streams at a 320 ms chunk size, roughly 3x the concurrency of a baseline streaming system at the same latency target. RTX A5000 and DGX B200 benchmarks show similar throughput gains, with more than 5x concurrency on A5000 and up to 2x on B200 across typical latency settings.\n\n\n\nEqually important, latency remains stable as concurrency increases. In Modal\u2019s tests with 127 concurrent WebSocket clients at 560 ms mode, the system maintained a median end to end delay around 182 ms without drift, which is essential for agents that must stay synchronized with live speech over multi minute sessions.\n\n\n\nTraining data and ecosystem integration\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR is trained mainly on the English portion of NVIDIA\u2019s Granary dataset along with a large mixture of public speech corpora, for a total of about 285k hours of audio. Datasets include YouTube Commons, YODAS2, Mosel, LibriLight, Fisher, Switchboard, WSJ, VCTK, VoxPopuli and multiple Mozilla Common Voice releases. Labels combine human and ASR generated transcripts.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR is a 0.6B parameter English streaming model that uses a cache aware FastConformer encoder with an RNNT decoder and operates on 16 kHz mono audio with at least 80 ms input chunks.\n\n\n\nThe model exposes 4 inference time chunk configurations, about 80 ms, 160 ms, 560 ms and 1.12 s, which let engineers trade latency for accuracy without retraining while keeping WER around 7.2 percent to 7.8 percent on standard ASR benchmarks.\n\n\n\nCache aware streaming removes overlapping window recomputation so each audio frame is encoded once, which yields about 3 times higher concurrent streams on H100, more than 5 times on RTX A5000 and up to 2 times on DGX B200 compared to a buffered streaming baseline at similar latency.\n\n\n\nIn an end to end voice agent with Nemotron Speech ASR, Nemotron 3 Nano 30B and Magpie TTS, measured median time to final transcription is about 24 ms and server side voice to voice latency on RTX 5090 is around 500 ms, which makes ASR a small fraction of the total latency budget.\n\n\n\nNemotron Speech ASR is released as a NeMo checkpoint under the NVIDIA Permissive Open Model License with open weights and training details, so teams can self host, fine tune and profile the full stack for low latency voice agents and speech applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the\u00a0MODEL WEIGHTS here.\u00a0Also,\u00a0feel free to follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and don\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0100k+ ML SubReddit\u00a0and Subscribe to\u00a0our Newsletter.

      "title": "Agentic AI scaling requires new memory architecture",
      "content": "Agentic AI represents a distinct evolution from stateless chatbots toward complex workflows, and scaling it requires new memory architecture.\n\n\n\nAs foundation models scale toward trillions of parameters and context windows reach millions of tokens, the computational cost of remembering history is rising faster than the ability to process it.\n\n\n\nOrganisations deploying these systems now face a bottleneck where the sheer volume of &#8220;long-term memory&#8221; (technically known as Key-Value (KV) cache) overwhelms existing hardware architectures.\n\n\n\nCurrent infrastructure forces a binary choice: store inference context in scarce, high-bandwidth GPU memory (HBM) or relegate it to slow, general-purpose storage. The former is prohibitively expensive for large contexts; the latter creates latency that renders real-time agentic interactions unviable.\n\n\n\nTo address this widening disparity that is holding back the scaling of agentic AI, NVIDIA has introduced the Inference Context Memory Storage (ICMS) platform within its Rubin architecture, proposing a new storage tier designed specifically to handle the ephemeral and high-velocity nature of AI memory.\n\n\n\n\u201cAI is revolutionising the entire computing stack\u2014and now, storage,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAI is no longer about one-shot chatbots but intelligent collaborators that understand the physical world, reason over long horizons, stay grounded in facts, use tools to do real work, and retain both short- and long-term memory.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe operational challenge lies in the specific behaviour of transformer-based models. To avoid recomputing an entire conversation history for every new word generated, models store previous states in the KV cache. In agentic workflows, this cache acts as persistent memory across tools and sessions, growing linearly with sequence length.\n\n\n\nThis creates a distinct data class. Unlike financial records or customer logs, KV cache is derived data; it is essential for immediate performance but does not require the heavy durability guarantees of enterprise file systems. General-purpose storage stacks, running on standard CPUs, expend energy on metadata management and replication that agentic workloads do not require.\n\n\n\nThe current hierarchy, spanning from GPU HBM (G1) to shared storage (G4), is becoming inefficient:\n\n\n\n(Credit: NVIDIA)\n\n\n\nAs context spills from the GPU (G1) to system RAM (G2) and eventually to shared storage (G4), efficiency plummets. Moving active context to the G4 tier introduces millisecond-level latency and increases the power cost per token, leaving expensive GPUs idle while they await data.\n\n\n\nFor the enterprise, this manifests as a bloated Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), where power is wasted on infrastructure overhead rather than active reasoning.\n\n\n\nA new memory tier for the AI factory\n\n\n\nThe industry response involves inserting a purpose-built layer into this hierarchy. The ICMS platform establishes a &#8220;G3.5&#8221; tier\u2014an Ethernet-attached flash layer designed explicitly for gigascale inference.\n\n\n\nThis approach integrates storage directly into the compute pod. By utilising the NVIDIA BlueField-4 data processor, the platform offloads the management of this context data from the host CPU. The system provides petabytes of shared capacity per pod, boosting the scaling of agentic AI by allowing agents to retain massive amounts of history without occupying expensive HBM.\n\n\n\nThe operational benefit is quantifiable in throughput and energy. By keeping relevant context in this intermediate tier \u2013 which is faster than standard storage, but cheaper than HBM \u2013 the system can &#8220;prestage&#8221; memory back to the GPU before it is needed. This reduces the idle time of the GPU decoder, enabling up to 5x higher tokens-per-second (TPS) for long-context workloads.\n\n\n\nFrom an energy perspective, the implications are equally measurable. Because the architecture removes the overhead of general-purpose storage protocols, it delivers 5x better power efficiency than traditional methods.\n\n\n\nIntegrating the data plane\n\n\n\nImplementing this architecture requires a change in how IT teams view storage networking. The ICMS platform relies on NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet to provide the high-bandwidth, low-jitter connectivity required to treat flash storage almost as if it were local memory.\n\n\n\nFor enterprise infrastructure teams, the integration point is the orchestration layer. Frameworks such as NVIDIA Dynamo and the Inference Transfer Library (NIXL) manage the movement of KV blocks between tiers.\n\n\n\nThese tools coordinate with the storage layer to ensure that the correct context is loaded into the GPU memory (G1) or host memory (G2) exactly when the AI model requires it. The NVIDIA DOCA framework further supports this by providing a KV communication layer that treats context cache as a first-class resource.\n\n\n\nMajor storage vendors are already aligning with this architecture. Companies including AIC, Cloudian, DDN, Dell Technologies, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, VAST Data, and WEKA are building platforms with BlueField-4. These solutions are expected to be available in the second half of this year.\n\n\n\nRedefining infrastructure for scaling agentic AI\n\n\n\nAdopting a dedicated context memory tier impacts capacity planning and datacentre design.\n\n\n\n\nReclassifying data: CIOs must recognise KV cache as a unique data type. It is &#8220;ephemeral but latency-sensitive,&#8221; distinct from &#8220;durable and cold&#8221; compliance data. The G3.5 tier handles the former, allowing durable G4 storage to focus on long-term logs and artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrchestration maturity: Success depends on software that can intelligently place workloads. The system uses topology-aware orchestration (via NVIDIA Grove) to place jobs near their cached context, minimising data movement across the fabric.\n\n\n\n\n\nPower density: By fitting more usable capacity into the same rack footprint, organisations can extend the life of existing facilities. However, this increases the density of compute per square metre, requiring adequate cooling and power distribution planning.\n\n\n\n\nThe transition to agentic AI forces a physical reconfiguration of the datacentre. The prevailing model of separating compute completely from slow, persistent storage is incompatible with the real-time retrieval needs of agents with photographic memories.\n\n\n\nBy introducing a specialised context tier, enterprises can decouple the growth of model memory from the cost of GPU HBM. This architecture for agentic AI allows multiple agents to share a massive low-power memory pool to reduce the cost of serving complex queries and boosts scaling by enabling high-throughput reasoning.\n\n\n\nAs organisations plan their next cycle of infrastructure investment, evaluating the efficiency of the memory hierarchy will be as vital as selecting the GPU itself.\n\n\n\nSee also: 2025\u2019s AI chip wars: What enterprise leaders learned about supply chain reality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

As a solar-powered \u201cartificial friend\u201d, bought as a companion and potential substitute for a sick teenage girl, Klara fulfils her duties with a loving loyalty that makes it impossible to think of her as a mere piece of tech.Brilliant, thought-provoking fiction. But back in the real world, anthropomorphising AI may not be such a clever idea. During the summer, Anthropic, a leading tech company, announced that in the interests of chatbot welfare, it was allowing its Claude Opus 4 model to avoid supposedly \u201cdistressing\u201d conversations with users. More broadly, amid explosive growth in AI capacities, there is emerging speculation over whether future Klaras may even deserve to be accorded legal rights like human beings.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
