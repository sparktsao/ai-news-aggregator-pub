      "content": "New post: nanochat miniseries v1\n\nThe correct way to think about LLMs is that you are not optimizing for a single specific model but for a family models controlled by a single dial (the compute you wish to spend) to achieve monotonically better results. This allows you to do careful science of scaling laws and ultimately this is what gives you the confidence that when you pay for \"the big run\", the extrapolation will work and your money will be well spent. For the first public release of nanochat my focus was on end-to-end pipeline that runs the whole LLM pipeline with all of its stages. Now after YOLOing a few runs earlier, I'm coming back around to flesh out some of the parts that I sped through, starting of course with pretraining, which is both computationally heavy and critical as the foundation of intelligence and knowledge in these models.\n\nAfter locally tuning some of the hyperparameters, I swept out a number of models fixing the FLOPs budget. (For every FLOPs target you can train a small model a long time, or a big model for a short time.) It turns out that nanochat obeys very nice scaling laws, basically reproducing the Chinchilla paper plots:\n\nWhich is just a baby version of this plot from Chinchilla:\nVery importantly and encouragingly, the exponent on N (parameters) and D (tokens) is equal at ~=0.5, so just like Chinchilla we get a single (compute-independent) constant that relates the model size to token training horizons. In Chinchilla, this was measured to be 20. In nanochat it seems to be 8!\n\nOnce we can train compute optimal models, I swept out a miniseries from d10 to d20, which are nanochat sizes that can do 2**19 ~= 0.5M batch sizes on 8XH100 node without gradient accumulation. We get pretty, non-itersecting training plots for each model size.\n\nThen the fun part is relating this miniseries v1 to the GPT-2 and GPT-3 miniseries so that we know we're on the right track. Validation loss has many issues and is not comparable, so instead I use the CORE score (from DCLM paper). I calculated it for GPT-2 and estimated it for GPT-3, which allows us to finally put nanochat nicely and on the same scale:\nThe total cost of this miniseries is only ~$100 (~4 hours on 8XH100). These experiments give us confidence that everything is working fairly nicely and that if we pay more (turn the dial), we get increasingly better models.\n\nTLDR: we can train compute optimal miniseries and relate them to GPT-2/3 via objective CORE scores, but further improvements are desirable and needed. E.g., matching GPT-2 currently needs ~$500, but imo should be possible to do <$100 with more work.\n\nFull post with a lot more detail is here:\nhttps://t.co/na8zVLqWLf\nAnd all of the tuning and code is pushed to master and people can reproduce these with scaling_laws .sh and miniseries .sh bash scripts.",

The writing was on the wall. And if you read my 2026 AI predictions, you saw it there too.\n\nWHAT IT IS👇\nChatGPT Health is a dedicated space inside ChatGPT where you can connect medical records, Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, and other wellness apps so AI can give you answers grounded in your actual health data. It can explain lab results, prep questions for a doctor visit, compare insurance plans (good god yes!!), and spot patterns in your sleep or activity over time.\n\nYour health context stays within Health and doesn't transfer into your regular chats. OpenAI also partnered with b.well, the largest connected health data network in the US so far, for medical record access. They also (thankfully) built this new release with 260+ physicians over two years, so it can better handle escalation and safety caveats.\n\nLIMITATIONS ❌\nMedical records and some app integrations are US-only. Apple Health requires iOS. Not available in EEA, Switzerland, or UK yet.\n\n230 million people already ask ChatGPT health questions every week. The pot was already boiling. OpenAI is just building to meet demand.\n\nWaitlist is open here: https://t.co/6BbWCYcQ0h",

      "content": "A major breakthrough in reinforcement learning for robot training and the NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper.\n\nWhen training robots to walk, navigate, or manipulate objects, RL researchers have usually been using relatively shallow networks—typically 2-5 layer MLPs mapping sensor readings to motor commands. Attempts to go deeper have failed because training becomes unstable and performance degrades.\n\nPrior work attributed these failures to RL's sparse feedback: you might get one bit of information after thousands of decisions, so the ratio of signal to parameters is tiny.\n\nIn this paper, the authors show that the problem was architectural rather than fundamental. With residual connections, layer normalization, and Swish activation—surprisingly standard elsewhere but not in control RL—you can train networks up to 1000+ layers.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that gains from adding layers aren't gradual: at certain depth thresholds, agents acquire new behaviors. A simulated humanoid learns to walk upright only at 16 layers; at 256 layers, it learns to vault over walls.\n\nRead online and ask questions when blocked: https://t.co/FUMFRxI9QW\n\nDownload the PDF: https://t.co/BvIgGj37Ot\n\nThe full list of the most important AI paper of 2025: https://t.co/fGEEd93F2A",

      "content": "Current LLMs all depend on tokenization, where raw text gets chopped into subword pieces from a fixed vocabulary before the model ever sees it. This is a brittle preprocessing step—the same word gets split differently depending on context and rare words get shredded into smaller fragments compared to more common words.\n\nBecause tokens are atomic units to the model, it has no direct access to what characters compose them, which is why current models struggle with tasks like \"how many r's are in strawberry\" or \"swap the first and last letter of this word.\"\n\nBLT proposes working directly on bytes instead, but the obvious problem is that byte sequences are much longer than token sequences, making computation expensive.\n\nThe paper's solution is to dynamically group bytes into variable-length \"patches\" based on how predictable the next byte is: easy-to-predict regions (like the ending of a common word) get bundled into large patches that need little computation, while hard-to-predict regions (like the start of a new sentence) get small patches and more processing.\n\nUnlike tokens, patches have no fixed vocabulary—any arbitrary byte sequence can become a patch, and the model builds a representation for it on the fly using a small encoder network that looks at the actual bytes. This means byte-level information is preserved throughout.\n\nThe result is an 8-billion parameter model that matches the performance of comparable tokenizer-based models while using significantly less computation at inference time, and it performs far better on character-level reasoning tasks (roughly 54% vs 27% on a character understanding benchmark).\n\nRead actively on ChapterPal: https://t.co/3dWqRJsdYs\n\nDownload the PDF: https://t.co/fZhkZWuYW7",

      "content": "@juanstoppa Why are we fighting? Because robots don't really do that much yet. They aren't generalized, so they can't do a variety of different tasks; they can only perform very specific tasks they've been trained for this year. That will change over time, but right now they're still quite limited. Fighting is something they can actually do.\n\nThe real reason for this is that fighting draws an audience:\n1. In San Francisco, we had 4,000 people show up for robot fights, which helps sell robots to the public.\n2. Part of why they're doing fights in China and here is to get people to see the robots, understand how they work, and get enthusiastic about them.\n3. It serves as a forcing function on the industry to finish the robots and make them better.\n\nAlready, the industry has learned from these fights that the actuators overheat quite a bit. As a result, they've actually started changing robot designs to better compete in various robot sports.\n\nIt is a temporary phase. Robot fights are fun, but the goal is to use this as a forcing function to get to the next level and bring robots into people's homes. After all, watching a robot fight is much more entertaining than watching one fold laundry.",

How to frame problems (this alone will save you months)\n2. How to build and evaluate RAG systems\n3. How to build AI agents that don't fall apart\n4. How to deploy and test in production\n5. How to set up monitoring and observability from day one\n\nMore than 3,000 students have taken this program. Students from Google, AWS, Netflix, and many other top companies.\n\nIt's 20+ hours of live classes, 100+ coding assignments, and a complete end-to-end system you can use as a template for your own projects.\n\nThis class doesn't care what the book says. It focuses on experience building software that actually works.\n\nThe next cohort starts February 2, 2026.\n\nYou can join at https://t.co/iZifcK7UTF.",

Ticketing, POS, broadcast, and crowd flow ride one wireless fabric. Less friction, faster ops, happier fans.\n\n→ Broadcast explodes in perspectives. More angles, less latency, interactive feeds you can steer.\n\n→ One network, many workloads. Dynamic bandwidth for what matters now—gate surges, replay reviews, merch spikes. \n\n→ Partnerships accelerate breakthroughs. Ref-cams, AR graphics, on-body antennas—none of these ships without tight cross-team engineering.\n\nCheck out the full article: https://t.co/wrx6ctxUzd\n\nCc: @EvanKirstel | @Chels_LA | @antgrasso | @HaroldSinnott |",

      "content": "💬 Do any of you still remember RealPlayer™?\n\nBack in the 1990s, websites were just text, links and if you were very lucky some images, but definitely NOT video or audio\n\nInternet speeds were extremely slow (think 2.5kb/s, so about 10,000 times slower than an average connection now) so it was simply impossible or it'd take ages to load\n\nRealPlayer changed that, they made a heavy compression codec for video and audio where a video could be just a few kilobytes, and with that it instantly became the first app that let people play real audio and video inside websites, it integrated into browsers like Netscape or Internet Explorer so people could embed video and audio on sites, and they did!\n\nRealPlayer was so successful that by the year 2000 more than 85% of all audio or video content on the web was in the RealPlayer format\n\nThe app itself was free for people to use, and they made money by charging for the server software that would stream the video and audio\n\nThey IPO'd during the internet bubble of the late 90s and were valued at $550 million dollars, which would be $1B inflation-adjusted now, so they were a billion dollar company\n\n(That internet bubble by the way has endless parallels with the AI bubble we're probably in today)\n\nSo why don't you hear about them these days anymore?\n\nWell, Microsoft started bundling Windows Media Player with Windows, just like they did bundling Internet Explorer, and they gave away the server software for streaming Windows Media content (like .wma and .wmv) for free\n\nThis overnight nuked RealPlayer's business, so they sued Microsoft for unfair competition, they won in court in 2005, and Microsoft agreed to pay them $761 million to settle, so I think the founder still got rich from it\n\nThat same year in 2005, YouTube started and around 2008 the HTML standard added the <video> tag while making most video streaming tech open source, so it wasn't a business anymore\n\nRealPlayer stayed public as a company though until actually recently, 2022, when the original founder @RobGlaser bought it back and took it private for about $25 million\n\nObviously nobody needs a video streaming app anymore, it's integrated in all platforms, software, and devices now, so now they seem to be focusing on \"AI-powered facial recognition for security professionals\"\n\nOn my site https://t.co/M1hEUBAynC I've installed RealPlayer for you go back into time and try and managed to the get streaming part working too, so you can listen to actual radio show from the 90s about UFOs at Roswell which I found on @textfiles's Discmaster archives\n\nThese days we all watch video on YouTube, Instagram, X and TikTok etc. but it all started with RealPlayer 😊",
