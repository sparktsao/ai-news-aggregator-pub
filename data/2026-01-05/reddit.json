      "content": "Contrary to popular belief, LLM assisted coding is an unbelievably difficult skill to master.\n\nCore philosophy: Any issue in LLM generated code is solely due to YOU. Errors are traceable to improper prompting or improper context engineering. Context rot (and lost in the middle) impacts the quality of output heavily, and does so very quickly.\n\nHere are the patterns that actually moved the needle for me. I guarantee you haven't heard of at least one:\n\n1. **Error Logging System**\u00a0\\- Reconstructing the input-output loop that agentic coding hides from you. Log failures with the exact triggering prompt, categorize them, ask \"what did I do wrong.\" Patterns emerge.\n2. **/Commands as Lightweight Local Apps**\u00a0\\- Slash commands are secretly one of the most powerful parts of Claude Code. I think of them as Claude as a Service, workflows with the power of a SaaS but way quicker to build.\n3. **Hooks for Deterministic Safety**\u00a0\\- dangerously-skip-permissions + hooks that prevent dangerous actions = flow state without fear.\n4. **Context Hygiene**\u00a0\\- Disable autocompact. Add a status line mentioning the % of context used. Compaction is now done when and how YOU choose. Double-escape time travel is the most underutilized feature in Claude Code.\n5. **Subagent Control**\u00a0\\- Claude Code consistently spawns Sonnet/Haiku subagents even for knowledge tasks. Add \"Always launch opus subagents\" to your global CLAUDE.md. Use subagents way more than you think for big projects. Orchestrator + Subagents &gt;&gt; Claude Code vanilla.\n6. **The Reprompter System**\u00a0\\- Voice dictation \u2192 clarifying questions \u2192 structured prompt with XML tags. Prompting at high quality without the friction of typing.\n\nI wrote up a 16 page google doc with more tips and details, exact slash commands, code for a subagent monitoring dashboard, and a quick reference table. Comment 'interested' if you want it.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI decided to deep dive into Chroma Radiance recently. Honestly, this model is a massive hidden gem that deserves way more attention. Huge thanks to Lodestone for all his hard work on this architecture and for keeping the spirit alive.\n\nThe biggest plus? Well, it delivers exactly what the Chroma series is famous for - combining impressive realism with the ability to do things that other commercial models just won't do \ud83d\ude0f. It is also highly trainable, flexible, and has excellent prompt adherence. (Chroma actually excels at various art styles too, not just realism, but I'll cover that in a future post).\n\nIMO, the biggest advantage is that this model operates in pixel\\_space (no VAE needed), which allows it to deliver the best results natively at 1024 resolution.\n\nSince getting LoRAs to work with it in ComfyUI can be tricky, I\u2019m releasing a fix along with two new LoRAs I trained (using lodestone's own trainer [flow](https://github.com/lodestone-rock/flow)).\n\nI\u2019ve also uploaded [q8, q6, and q4 quants,](https://huggingface.co/Danrisi/ChromaRadiance_x0_Latest28.31_GGUF) so feel free to use them if you have low VRAM.\n\n# \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f The Fix: How to make LoRAs work\n\nTo get LoRAs running, you need to modify two specific python files in your ComfyUI installation. I have uploaded the modified files and a custom Workflow to the repository below. Please grab them from there, otherwise, the LoRAs might not load correctly.\n\n\ud83d\udc49[Download the Fix &amp; Workflow here (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/Danrisi/Lenovo_ChromaRadiance)\n\n# My New LoRAs\n\n1. Lenovo ChromaRadiance (Style/Realism) This is for texture and atmosphere. It pushes the model towards that \"raw,\" unpolished realism, mimicking the aesthetic of 2010s phone cameras. It adds noise, grain, and realistic lighting artifacts. (Soon I'll train more LoRAs for this model).\n2. NiceGirls ChromaRadiance (Character/Diversity) This creates aesthetically pleasing female characters. I focused heavily on diversity here - different races and facial structures.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: These work great when combined\n\n* Suggested weights: NiceGirls at 0.6 + Lenovo at 0.8.\n\n# \u2699\ufe0f Quick Settings Tips\n\n* Best Quality: fully\\_implicit samplers (like radau\\_iia\\_2s or gauss-legendre\\_2s) at 20-30 steps.\n* Faster: res2m + beta (40-50 steps).\n\n# \ud83d\udd17 Links &amp; Community\n\n* Lenovo (Realism + Fix files): [HuggingFace Link](https://huggingface.co/Danrisi/Lenovo_ChromaRadiance)\n* NiceGirls (Characters): [HuggingFace Link](https://huggingface.co/Danrisi/NiceGirls_ChromaRadiance)\n\nWant to see more examples? Since I can't post everything here \ud83d\ude0f, I just created a Discord server. Join to check to chat and hang out \ud83d\udc49[Join Discord](https://discord.gg/xbTCdeub)\n\nP.S.

      "title": "Introducing Adaptive-P: A New Sampler for Creative Text Generation (llama.cpp PR)",
      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a sampling method we've been working on called Adaptive-P. Before I get into it, I should mention that due to a visual impairment, I used AI assistance in writing both the documentation and this post. I want to be upfront about that. The algorithm itself and the underlying idea are human created, however.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAdaptive-P is a different approach to token sampling that tries to address models getting stuck in predictable patterns. When generating creative content, models often fall back on the same phrasing, sentence structures, and narrative beats. The model has more interesting options available, but standard sampling methods don't give you a way to encourage it toward those alternatives.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nInstead of uniformly scaling probabilities like temperature does, or making binary keep/discard decisions like truncation methods, Adaptive-P lets you specify a probability range you want to target. It applies a transformation that creates a preference curve centered on your target probability\u2014tokens near the target get boosted, tokens far from it get suppressed.\n\nThe transformation uses unbounded negative logits for distant tokens rather than a floor value. This prevents probability from accumulating in the tail of the distribution, which is a problem that affects some other approaches to forced alternative selection.\n\nThe sampler maintains an exponential moving average of the original probabilities of selected tokens. It uses this history to compute an adjusted target at each step. If recent selections have been running above your configured target, the sampler compensates by aiming lower on the next step, and vice versa. This feedback loop keeps the average selection probability tracking toward your target over time.\n\n**Chain breaking**\n\nThe adaptive mechanism is what breaks repetitive high-confidence chains. When the model keeps selecting dominant tokens, the history shifts upward, which pushes the calculated target downward, which makes alternatives more attractive. The sampler naturally resists getting stuck in a rut without requiring external repetition penalties.\n\n**What's it good for?**\n\nThis is designed for creative work\u2014fiction, roleplay, brainstorming. It's not meant for tasks where accuracy matters more than variety.\n\nIt pairs well with Min-P, which handles removing genuinely bad options while Adaptive-P handles selection among the remaining quality candidates. Adaptive-P needs to be the final sampler in the chain since it performs the actual token selection.\n\n**Links**\n\nDocumentation: \nhttps://github.com/MrJackSpade/adaptive-p-docs/blob/main/Documentation.md\n\nllama.cpp PR: \nhttps://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/17927\n\nDiscord discussion: \nhttps://discord.com/channels/1238219753324281886/1447392417769721926\n\nAny and all questions will likely be answered by the documentation, or the discord server.\n\n#EDIT:\n\nI just want to note, the only implementation I have personally been involved with is the Llama.cpp one. \n\nThe Kobold implementation was done by Concedo, and a few users have reported that there may be issues with generation speed and repetition. The IK implementation is being done by a very enthusiastic individual, however it currently has a number of issues that are being worked through. \n\nThe best way to try this sampler is the Llama.cpp one. We will be working to ensure that any issues with the other engines get worked out as best we can, but the Llama.cpp PR is the only one that we have direct control over.",

      "content": "Bernard Widrow passed away recently. I took his neural networks and signal processing courses at Stanford in the early 2000s, and later interacted with him again years after. I\u2019m writing down a few recollections, mostly technical and classroom-related, while they are still clear.\n\nOne thing that still strikes me is how\u00a0*complete*\u00a0his view of neural networks already was decades ago. In his classes, neural nets were not presented as a speculative idea or a future promise, but as an engineering system: learning rules, stability, noise, quantization, hardware constraints, and failure modes. Many things that get rebranded today had already been discussed very concretely.\n\nHe often showed us videos and demos from the 1990s. At the time, I remember being surprised by how much reinforcement learning, adaptive filtering, and online learning had already been implemented and tested long before modern compute made them fashionable again. Looking back now, that surprise feels na\u00efve.\n\nWidrow also liked to talk about hardware. One story I still remember clearly was about an early neural network hardware prototype he carried with him. He explained why it had a glass enclosure: without it, airport security would not allow it through. The anecdote was amusing, but it also reflected how seriously he took the idea that learning systems should exist as real, physical systems, not just equations on paper.\n\nHe spoke respectfully about others who worked on similar ideas. I recall him mentioning Frank Rosenblatt, who independently developed early neural network models. Widrow once said he had written to Cornell suggesting they treat Rosenblatt kindly, even though at the time Widrow himself was a junior faculty member hoping to be treated kindly by MIT/Stanford. Only much later did I fully understand what that kind of professional courtesy meant in an academic context.\n\nAs a teacher, he was patient and precise. He didn\u2019t oversell ideas, and he didn\u2019t dramatize uncertainty. Neural networks, stochastic gradient descent, adaptive filters. These were tools, with strengths and limitations, not ideology.\n\nLooking back now, what stays with me most is not just how early he was, but how\u00a0*engineering-oriented*\u00a0his thinking remained throughout. Many of today\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d ideas were already being treated by him as practical problems decades ago: how they behave under noise, how they fail, and what assumptions actually matter.\n\nI don\u2019t have a grand conclusion. These are just a few memories from a student who happened to see that era up close.\n\nwhich I just wrote on the new year date. Prof. Widrow had a huge influence on me. As I wrote in the end of the post: \"For me, Bernie was not only a scientific pioneer, but also a mentor whose quiet support shaped key moments of my life. Remembering him today is both a professional reflection and a deeply personal one.\"\n\n  \n",

We've been trending towards lower percentage of Active params, probably because of the focus on benchmarks. Models have to know all sorts of trivia to pass all those multiple-choice tests, and know various programming languages to pass coding benchmarks.\n\nI personally prefer high Active (sometimes preferring dense models for this reason), because I mainly use local LLMs for creative writing or one-off local tasks where I want it to read between the lines instead of me having to be extremely clear.\n\nFun thought: how would some popular models have changed with a different parameter count?

      "title": "Claude Code for Non-Coding Projects/Work: A Complete Getting Started Guide",
      "content": "Most people think Claude Code is just for developers. **It's not**. Claude Code is actually one of the most powerful personal automation tools available, and you don't need to write a single line of code to use it.\n\nA lot of people on this sub are exploring ways to use the power of Claude Code for non-coding use cases. This is the guide for you! I have also been around this sub touting the benefits of [Output Styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles), so hopefully this can help for you too!\n\nI've been using Claude Code, since it came out in early 2025, to manage my personal knowledge base (Obsidian vault), process meeting notes, track media, and automate workflows across my work and my life (and yes, also to do some code too, but thats not for this guide!).\n\nHere's how you can get started:\n\n# 1. Setup\n\nCreate a project folder and run Claude Code from it, from your OS Terminal app:\n\n    mkdir ~/Documents/MyProject\n    cd ~/Documents/MyProject\n    claude\n\nThat's it. You're in an interactive Claude Code session.\n\n**Why the folder matters**: Claude Code operates within your current directory. All configuration files live here. *Different folders = different projects/work with different configurations.*\n\n**First run**: Claude will help you authenticate. After that, just type `cd` to any project folder and run `claude`.\n\n**Pro tip**: Once you're proficient and trust your setup, you can skip permission prompts (***DO NOT DO THIS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS!***):\n\n    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n\n# 2. The Key Insight\n\n**Claude Code can fully configure itself, you just have to ask.**\n\nIt won't proactively suggest creating configuration files. You need to know what to request.\n\n|Building Block|What It Does|Question It Answers|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CLAUDE.md**|Project memory|*What's the purpose of this project/work?*|\n|**Output Style**|Changes Claude's behavior|*How should Claude behave?*|\n|**Skills**|Specialized workflows|*What are your specific workflows?*|\n|**Subagents**|Delegated assistants|*What tasks need dedicated focus?*|\n\nYou can also run `/init` to bootstrap a basic CLAUDE.md, but you'll want to expand it.\n\n**Starter prompt** \u2014 Copy this to kick off your setup:\n\n&gt;I'm setting up Claude Code for ***\\[describe your project/work\\].***\n\n&gt;Help me design the right configuration:  \n\\- What should my CLAUDE.md contain for this use case?  \n\\- Help me create a Claude Code output style that would work best for this work.  \n\\- What skills would help us work more efficiently?  \n\\- Would any custom subagents be useful?\n\n&gt;Ask me questions to fully understand my workflow before making any recommendations. Check the Claude docs for the latest specs on all of these configuration items.\n\n# 3. CLAUDE.md \u2014 What's the purpose of this project/work?\n\nThe CLAUDE.md file is your project's memory. It tells Claude everything about your project/work and your preferences. Claude reads this at the start of every session.\n\n**Location**: `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`\n\n**What to include**:\n\n* Project/work overview and purpose\n* Folder structure (if managing files)\n* Common workflows and how to handle them\n* Templates and formatting preferences\n* Domain-specific terminology\n\n**Example prompt**:\n\n&gt;\"Help me create a CLAUDE.md file for this project/work. I'm using this folder for personal knowledge management. Ask me questions about my workflow so you can set it up properly. Check the Claude docs to ensure the CLAUDE.md file is built correctly\"\n\n**Quick tip**: Tell Claude during a session to add notes to your CLAUDE.md:\n\n    Remember that I prefer bullet points over numbered lists\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Docs**: [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)\n\n# 4. Output Style \u2014 How should Claude behave?\n\nOutput Styles customize *how* Claude responds. This is where you shift Claude away from its default software-engineering/coding focus.\n\n**Location**: `~/.claude/output-styles/` (personal) or `.claude/output-styles/` (project)\n\n**Example prompt**:\n\n&gt;\"Help me create a custom output style for knowledge management. I want Claude to focus on organizing information, not writing code. Ask me questions about the way I want you to behave when we are working on this.  Save it to my output-styles folder. Check the Claude Docs to ensure output style is built correctly\"\n\n**To switch styles**: `/output-style` for the menu. (*After any changes to the output style, be sure to* `/exit` *Claude Code and then* `claude -c` *to continue the previous chat*)\n\n# Disabling Coding Focus\n\nThe key is `keep-coding-instructions: false` in the frontmatter. This is the **default** for custom output styles, so Claude's system prompt will:\n\n* Exclude instructions for efficient code output\n* Exclude coding verification and testing patterns\n* Focus entirely on your custom instructions\n\nIn practice, an Output Style with clear [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) instructions is usually enough...\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Docs**: [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles)\n\n# 5. Skills \u2014 What are your specific workflows?\n\n[Agent Skills, now an open format](https://agentskills.io/home), are specialized capabilities that Claude activates automatically when your request matches the skill's description. Think of them as \"expertise modules.\" It's Neo in the Matrix learning Kung Fu.\n\n**Location**: `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (personal)\n\n**Example prompt**:\n\n&gt;\"Help me create a skill for processing meeting notes. I prefer my notes to be structured the following way: \\[*include examples*\\]. Walk me through what else a SKILL.md file needs. Check the Claude Docs to ensure the Agent Skill is built correctly and with the latest specs\"\n\n**How it works**: When you say \"I just had a call with John about the Q1 budget,\" Claude recognizes this matches the skill's description and automatically loads it.  Claude can even create code scripts (because it still knows *how* to code) to validate accuracy of an output as a part of the skill!\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Docs**: [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)\n\n# 6. Subagents \u2014 What tasks need dedicated focus?\n\nSubagents are specialized \"assistants\" with their own dedicated context windows. They're powerful because:\n\n* **Separate context** \u2014 They don't bloat your main conversation\n* **Specialized focus** \u2014 Each agent has specific expertise\n* **Parallel work** \u2014 They can research while you continue working\n\n**Location**: `.claude/agents/` (project) or `~/.claude/agents/` (personal)\n\n# Built-in Subagent Types\n\n|Type|Purpose|Best For|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Explore**|Fast, read-only searching|Finding files, understanding structure|\n|**Plan**|Research and analysis|Complex planning, investigation|\n|**General-Purpose**|Full capabilities|Multi-step tasks needing both research and action|\n\n**Example prompt**:\n\n&gt;\"Help me set up a custom subagent for \\[*explain the purpose the agent will handle*\\].  Check the Claude Docs to ensure the Subagent is built correctly using the latests specs.\"\n\n**Why this matters for non-coders**: Think of it as hiring focused specialists, who still report up to the manager. Each one stays focused on its job.\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Docs**: [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)\n\n# Documentation Links (from Anthropic)\n\n**Essential**:\n\n* [Getting Started](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart)\n* [Installation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)\n* [CLAUDE.md (Memory)](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)\n* [Output Styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles)\n* [Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)\n* [Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)\n\n**Additional**:\n\n* [Settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)\n* [Slash Commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands)\n* [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide)\n* [MCP Servers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) (*Didn't cover, but I prefer Skills &gt; MCP, less token bloat*)\n\n# My Setup (Example)\n\nHere's some of what I use Claude Code for...zero coding involved:\n\n* **Personal Knowledge Base**: Obsidian vault with 400+ notes\n* **Meeting Processing**: Auto-capture and organize meeting notes from Granola\n* **Media Tracking**: Movies and TV shows synced with my media server (and fixes issues)\n* **Smart Home Automation:** With Skills, securely connects to my Home Assistant instance to help me manage, fix issues and build automations\n* **Research**: Deep dives on topics with web search and synthesis (***Pro Tip***: Use the awesome [NotebookLM](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill) and [Playwright](https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill) skills to extract even more!)\n* **Writing**: Draft documents, emails, and posts (like this one!)\n\n**My Obsidian configuration includes**:\n\n* Custom output style for knowledge management\n* 10+ skills for different workflows\n* Multiple subagents for research, analysis, and processing\n* Commands for automating repetitive tasks (**Bonus**, *ask for Commands too!*)\n\n# TL;DR - Getting Started Checklist\n\n1. Create a project folder\n2. Run `claude` from that folder\n3. **Ask Claude** to create a **CLAUDE.md** \u2014 *What's the purpose of this project/work?*\n4. **Ask Claude** to create an **output style** \u2014 *How should Claude behave? (Does it need to code?)*\n5. **Ask Claude** to create **skills** \u2014 *What are your specific workflows?*\n6. **Ask Claude** to create **subagents** \u2014 *What tasks need dedicated focus?*\n\n**Key insight**: Claude Code can build you all of the tooling you need to help you run Claude Code for any task! All you need to do is ask! This guide tells you *what* to ask for.\n\n# Questions?\n\nDrop them in the comments. Happy to share more about specific configurations or use cases.  Remember, when in doubt....**Ask Claude!**\n\n*This post's content was assisted by Claude Code, naturally.*",

Trying to figure out if there\u2019s any actual benefit to using Sonnet 4.5 or Haiku 4.5 for Claude Code tasks beyond faster response times.\n\nFrom what I understand:\n\n\t\u2219\tOpus 4.5 is objectively the most capable - best reasoning, most accurate code generation, better at handling complex requirements\n\n\t\u2219\tSonnet 4.5 is faster (2-3x) and cheaper, but otherwise just produces lower quality output\n\n\t\u2219\tHaiku 4.5 is even faster but even less capable\n\nSince I can switch models mid-conversation and limits aren\u2019t my concern, is there any situation where Sonnet or Haiku would actually produce better code for certain types of tasks? Or is it purely a speed vs. quality trade-off where Opus wins every time if you\u2019re willing to wait?\n\nI\u2019m currently defaulting to Opus for everything and just accepting the slightly longer response times, but wanted to check if I\u2019m missing something - like maybe Sonnet is actually better for straightforward CRUD implementations or something?\n\nFor context, I\u2019m building internal automation tools and workflow systems, not huge production applications.

Fluid real time motion, no people crawling along at slow motion. Prompts that do exactly what I want.\n\nSo what is changed? The workflow I downloaded was this one:\n\n[https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24359648/wan22\\_SVI\\_Pro\\_native\\_example\\_KJ.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24359648/wan22_SVI_Pro_native_example_KJ.json)\n\nFrom this thread:\n\n[https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1718#issuecomment-3694691603](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1718#issuecomment-3694691603)\n\nAll I changed was the \"Set Model High\" node input now comes out of \"ModelSamplingSD3\" and the model input to the \"Basic Scheduler\" node now comes from \"Diffusion Model Loader KJ\". So ModelSamplingSD3 does not go in to the BasicScheduler.\n\nWhy does this work? No idea. Might this break something? Possibly. Seems good to me so far but no guarantees. Maybe someone more informed can chime in and explain but otherwise please give this a try and see what you find.",

Cloud providers, chip makers, and platform companies fund, enable, and benefit from these startups at the same time. \n\nFrom the outside, it looks like innovation. From the inside, it sometimes feels more like capital moving in circles.\nI work in IT and spend a lot of time dealing with enterprise tools. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen countless products that technically \u201cwork\u201d but still make daily operations worse. More tools, more dashboards, more alerts, more manual stitching between systems. Instead of removing friction, they quietly add it.\n\nWhen I look at many AI products today, I see a similar pattern emerging.\n\u201cthis exists because it can, not because it should.\u201d\nA lot of teams seem incentivized to build quickly on top of existing models, prove demand through demos, and move on. That makes sense in a fast funding environment. But it also raises a longer term question: if most effort goes into wrappers and interfaces, who is actually investing in deeply understanding workflows, edge cases, and the boring constraints that make tools reliable at scale?\n\n\nIf this cycle continues, the future might split in two directions:\nA large number of AI products optimized for perception, speed, and distribution and,\nA much smaller number optimized for integration, durability, and necessity\n\nAre our current incentives actively delaying the kind of AI innovation that\u2019s genuinely needed?",

The job title isn't.\n\nCompanies aren't hiring \"prompt engineers.\" They're expecting everyone to already know how to use AI effectively in their role.\n\nIf you're in marketing, they expect you to use AI for content, campaigns, and analysis. If you're in ops, they expect you to use AI for process documentation and workflow optimization. If you're in sales, they expect you to use AI for outreach, proposals, and research.\n\nThe competitive advantage isn't \"I know AI exists.\" It's \"I know how to get reliable, high-quality outputs that actually save time.\"\n\nMost people can use ChatGPT to get... something.

No context about who the audience is, no constraints on length or tone, no format specification.\n\nAdding those four elements consistently transforms generic outputs into usable ones.\n\n**2. Chain-of-thought for complex work**\n\nWhen you need AI to actually think through a problem (not just generate text), you have to explicitly tell it to show its reasoning.\n\n\"Before writing the strategy, first analyze the market conditions, then identify key opportunities, then develop the approach.\"\n\nThis multi-step structure improves accuracy by 30-80% for complex tasks. But most people skip it and wonder why the output is superficial.\n\n**3. Few-shot examples for consistency**\n\nIf you need AI to match a specific style or format, showing it 2-3 examples works better than any amount of description.\n\n\"Write like this \\[example 1\\], not like this \\[example 2\\].\"\n\nThis is how you get AI to actually replicate brand voice or maintain consistency across content.\n\n**4. Prompt chaining for real projects**\n\nComplex work doesn't happen in one prompt. You need workflows.\n\nStep 1: Research and gather information\n\nStep 2: Analyze and identify patterns\n\nStep 3: Generate outline based on analysis\n\nStep 4: Write content following outline\n\nBreaking projects into chains gives you better control and higher quality at each stage.\n\n**The current market reality (2026):**\n\nFreelance prompt engineering services: $750-$3,500 per project \n\nCustom GPT development: $1,500-$7,500+ per build \n\nAI training workshops: $2,500-$15,000+ for corporate training \n\nMonthly retainers: $1,000-$5,000+/month for ongoing AI implementation\n\nThese aren't \"prompt engineer\" jobs. These are people who learned the frameworks, implemented them in their work, then monetized that expertise.\n\n**If you're serious about this:**\n\nYou need to learn:\n\n* The C-T-C-F framework for structuring any prompt\n* Chain-of-thought for complex reasoning tasks\n* Few-shot examples for consistency\n* Prompt chaining for multi-step projects\n* How to build custom GPTs for repeated workflows\n\nThese aren't optional \"advanced techniques.\" They're the baseline for getting AI to actually work well.\n\nI have 5 prompts examples using the CTCF rule, if you want them, just let me know.\n\nThe shift from \"I use AI\" to \"I know how to make AI useful\" is what creates actual value in 2026.",

      "content": "I lead a data intelligence team and have been using Claude Code for the past few months across our stack. Wanted to share what's been working in case it's useful with videos for how I've set it up, and curious what others have built.\n\n**What I've set up:**\n\nFor **Snowflake**, I have Claude Code connected via the Snowflake CLI. The main wins have been schema exploration (asking \"what tables have customer data\" across hundreds of tables), SQL optimization, and debugging. I give it access to our docs and style guides in CLAUDE.md so the output matches our standards. [Here](https://youtu.be/q1y7M5mZkkE) is the video for Snowflake + Claude Code.\n\nFor **Databricks**, I use it for managing Jobs, working with Notebooks, and navigating Unity Catalog. The CLI integration lets Claude read job configs and suggest fixes when something fails. [Here](https://youtu.be/5_q7j-k8DbM) is the video Claude Code + Databricks.\n\nFor **Jira**, this one took more iteration. I set up a workflow where Claude reads a ticket, pulls in relevant context (table schemas, existing code patterns), and drafts the implementation. I review and adjust, but it handles maybe 70% of the execution autonomously now. [Here](https://youtu.be/WRvgMzYaIVo) is the video for Claude Code + Jira.\n\nI also adapted the PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) framework for data object creation - basically a structured way to give Claude all the context it needs to build SQL views/tables correctly on the first try. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUK39XqEVm0) is the video for this framework.\n\nI've also adapted Claude Code itself adding in custom commands, custom agents, CLAUDE.md files, and other structure that has really lended itself well to data work as well. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4g4yBcBNuE) is the video for that.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I run [this small YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRi29nXFxNBuPhjseoB6AQ) I'm trying to grow where I documented these setups as I built them. I'm not selling anything - the videos are free and just walk through the actual workflows. I'm mainly posting to see what your reactions are to these setups, and how others are approaching this and if there are better patterns I'm missing.\n\nWhat's your Claude Code setup look like for data work? Anyone doing anything interesting with dbt, Airflow, or other tools?",

The AI without image generation capabilities did it best.\n\n\n\nHere's what Claude did autonomously with Computer Use:\n\n1. Installed necessary Python libraries (rembg, OpenCV, PIL)\n\n2. Tried THREE different approaches:\n\n   \\- Basic threshold method\n\n   \\- Color-based detection (targeting the orange infinity symbol)\n\n   \\- GrabCut algorithm (AI-powered precision removal)\n\n3.

      "title": "I've been using CC as a personal \"Executive Support Officer\" \u2014 here's what works and doesnt",
      "content": "I run a small consulting business and was / am  drowning in admin. Calendar entries, email triage, task management. All the things that eats away at your day without producing anything much. So I started using  Claude Code (CC) not for code, but as a personal ESO (Executive Support Officer) assitant.\n\nMy key idea is that CC can run CLI tools. If I make my workflow  command line based, CC can work it. My stack is khal for calendar (syncs via CalDAV), vdirsync for contacts, notmuch for email search, and Taskwarrior for task management. All terminal tools, all scriptable.\n\n**The** [**CLAUDE.md**](http://CLAUDE.md) **file**\n\nI setup a new project for my eso (called business-eso) and where I spec how the system works. Here's a snippet:\n\n    ### Date and Time Handling\n    - **Always use `date` command** - Never assume or use cached dates\n    - Format: YYYY-MM-DD for filenames and documentation\n    \n    ### Quick Commands\n    # Get current date (always check first!)\n    date\n    \n    # Check today's priorities\n    task project:BUSINESS due:today list\n    \n    # Add task with project\n    task add project:BUSINESS.Finance due:eow \"Reconcile August expenses\"\n\nThe \"always check the date first\" rule is crucial. Without it, CC always gets confused about what \"next Thursday\" means. Now it runs \\`date\\` before any calendar operation.\n\n**Creating tasks from emails**\n\nThis one took some iteration. When I'm processing email, I ask  \"create a task to follow up on this client email by Friday\" and Claude runs:\n\n    task add project:10FIFTEEN.Clients priority:H due:friday \"Follow up with XYZ proposal\" +client +email\n\nThe key is documenting your Taskwarrior project structure in CLAUDE.md. I have namespaced projects like \\`BUSINESS.Finance\\`, \\`BUSINESS.Clients\\`, \\`BUSINESS.Admin\\`. Once CC  knows the pattern, it (mostly!) routes tasks correctly.\n\n**Actual interactions from today:**\n\nMe: \"Please create an appointment for my son's doctor visit this Thursday at 3:30pm\"\n\nClaude checks today's date with \\`date\\`, calculates Thursday, runs \\`khal new\\` with the right format. Done.\n\nMe: \"Find emails from XYZ about timesheets\"\n\nCC runs \\`notmuch search from:xyz.com.au AND subject:timesheet\\` and summarises the results. I can then say \"create a task to submit my timesheet\" and it knows the pattern.\n\n**Contacts file to stop the hallucinations**\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way: CC will confidently make up people's names and email addresses if you don't give it a reference. I now keep a \\`contacts.yaml\\` in the project:\n\n    - name: Sarah Chen\n      email: sarah@clientcorp.com\n      company: ClientCorp\n      role: PM\n    - name: Mike Davidson\n      email: mike.d@recruiters.com.au\n      company: XyZ Recruitment\n\nThen in CLAUDE.md: \"Always check contacts.yaml before using names or email addresses.\"\n\nStill doesn't get it perfect but way better than before. And I never let CC actually send emails directly \u2014 it drafts them in my Obsidian notes folder and I review before sending. Too risky otherwise.\n\n**What doesn't work well**\n\nCalendar invites to other people \u2014 khal doesn't handle that gracefully. Complex recurring events are hit-or-miss. Sometimes Claude forgets conventions between sessions, so I keep adding more explicit stuff to CLAUDE.md.\n\nEmail addresses are still dodgy even with the contacts file. I've accepted that CC drafts emails, I send them.\n\n**The mental shift**\n\nTreate CC as an assistant who needs an operations manual, not a magic tool. I say \"please schedule\" not \"run khal new\". The [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) gives it enough context to translate my intent into the right commands.  Add in obsidian and it gives more context for tasks, emails and projects.\n\n**The annoying but necessary bit**\n\nDocument as you go. When CC does something wrong, don't just fix it. Tell CC to root cause it and update its [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) straight away. It's frustrating and slows you down, but that's how it the system gets better over time. Ask why it thought something wrong was right Six months of \"actually, the person name is...\" and now it mostly gets things right first try.\n\nI've also built some slash commands (like \\`/email-action-sweep\\` to process my inbox) but that's probably a separate post about structuring CC workflows.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Curious what CLI tools others are integrating.  BTW,  I live in WSL linux so CC runs on my Windows machine with its cli tools.",

      "title": "Tips and tricks to get the most out of Claude Code (and why Vibe Coding is costing you money)",
      "content": "I keep seeing posts here where people are furiously trying to reverse-engineer \"secret\" enterprise workflows, releasing custom implementations as if they\u2019ve discovered fire.\n\nHonestly? You\u2019re overthinking it.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the prompts you write; it\u2019s about the architecture you use. I\u2019ve spent the last few months obsessed with optimizing Claude Code (CC) and other AI tools, eventually building my own orchestration framework to automate the boring parts. Here is a list of tools and patterns that actually work for me.\n\n### 1. First Plan, Then Execute\nYou may call it Spec-Driven Development (SDD), you may call it simply planning, but essentially it's the same thing. Real-life development teams have been doing this forever: a well-curated plan results in a well-engineered project.\n\nYou can't go \"all in\" from the start. Eventually, your Agent's context window will overfill and you will get lost in the progress you've made. **Vibe-coding is just AI-coding without proper structure.** If you guide your Agent through a centralized and constitutional plan document, once it fills up and starts hallucinating, you can easily manually reconstruct the progress context using that doc.\n\nA list of SDD workflows/tools that work well with CC:\n* **GitHub Spec-kit:** https://github.com/github/spec-kit\n* **OpenSpec:** https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec\n* **APM (Agentic Project Management):** https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/ (This is the framework I built, it uses dedicated CC instance as a Setup Agent to do project discovery and planning)\n* **CC SDD:** https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd (A bit opinionated since it forces development order).\n\n### 2. Find a way for Claude to validate its actions\nThis is kinda obvious but for some it might sound new. Since the creator of CC emphasized it, I should mention it: Claude will always make mistakes, but with proper guidance it can correct itself.\n\nLatest frontier models like Opus 4.5 have strong agentic capabilities that don't require the user to babysit them. This allows us to create loops where the user provides a request + a way to validate success, and leaves it to the model to iterate.\n\nIn the development of CC, Boris explained that their way of self-validation included giving Claude access to the CC web UI, where it validated the features it just implemented. You should always define the success state of what you request from CC - kinda like Test Driven Development for LLMs.\n* **Boris's setup:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177\n* **Reddit post wiht a nice breakdown:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q2c0ne/claude_code_creator_boris_shares_his_setup_with/\n\n**Note:** \"Agent Skills\" recently introduced by Anthropic are a great way to 'teach' your CC how to use available tools and in what way to validate itself.\n\n### 3. Use multiple instances of CC (Multi-Agent Orchestration)\nThis has multiple benefits. First, it is simply more economically efficient. Context usage grows linearly, but cost grows *quadratically* (or at least accumulates massively) because every time you send a new message, you re-send the entire chat history to your LLM. Breaking your conversation into chunks based on logical domains is more efficient for your wallet and for Anthropic's rate limits.\n* Reference on a nice limits/cost reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q375z9/i_reverseengineered_claudes_message_limits_heres/\n\nSecondly, distributing workload is more effective. It is better to have a CC for Frontend, a CC for Backend, and a CC for DB. The secret sauce here is how these separate CC instances interact with eachother.\n\nHow do these agents communicate? I use a central Memory Bank acting as a context archive. All agents log their work there. When Frontend needs the Backend API, it fetches *just the relevant log*, not the entire Backend chat history or the complete source codee. This limits context transfer and prevents \"pollution.\"\n* I explain this architecture in detail in the advanced docs of my framework here (it's biased towards my tool, but the logic applies universally): https://agentic-project-management.dev/docs/context-and-memory-management\n\n### 4. Use MCP properly\nDon't flood your workspace with unlimited MCP servers. Constant tool description exposure consumes useful context.\n\nI limit my global MCP usage to minimal-essential servers like **Context7** (https://context7.com/) and **Chrome DevTools** (https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp). When I have a specific need, I use local MCP configuration so only *that* CC instance sees the tool. This prevents confusion points where similar tool descriptions cause hallucinations and bad tool calls.\n\n### 5. Do pro-active handovers when context limits are reached\nEven with multiple agents, complex projects will eventually fill the context window. **I don't trust chat history compression.** It usually leaves big context gaps that you realize too late.\n\nI suggest switching to a new instance **proactively** (at around 80% usage). To do this effectively, you would need to design something like a \"Handover Protocol\" -a slash command or hook- where the outgoing agent writes all undocumented context, decisions, and working memory to a dedicated file (or files). The new agent reads that file to reconstruct the state without burning tokens re-reading the whole chat history.\n* In APM, I automated this with slash commands (`/handover`), which uses the Memory Logs to reconstruct context instantly. If you are doing it manually, just make sure you instruct your agent to \"store its working memory to a file\" before you kill the session.\n\nAnyway, the point is: stop treating Claude like a magic black box and start treating it like a junior dev that needs a spec and a PM. Adding structure is the only way to stop burning tokens in cycles and getting somewhat expected behavior from your Agent. I built APM because I was tired of doing all this manual context management myself, but the principles apply regardless of the tool you use. Hopefully, this saves you some trial and error.

They translate the *words*, but miss the *context*.\n\nWe built **gemma-3-4B-T1-it**, a specialized version of Google's new Gemma 3 designed specifically for the context of **Taiwan**.

      "content": "Hey guys, it\u2019s been a while but I\u2019m happy to announce a major update for **EasyWhisperUI**.\n\nWhisper is OpenAI\u2019s automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that converts audio into text, and it can also translate speech into English. It\u2019s commonly used for transcribing things like meetings, lectures, podcasts, and videos with strong accuracy across many languages.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen my earlier posts, EasyWhisperUI originally used a **Qt-based UI**. After a lot of iteration, I\u2019ve now migrated the app to an **Electron architecture (React + Electron + IPC)**.\n\nThe whole point of EasyWhisperUI is simple: **make the entire Whisper/whisper.cpp process extremely beginner friendly**. No digging through CLI flags, no \u201cfigure out models yourself,\u201d no piecing together FFmpeg, no confusing setup steps. You download the app, pick a model, drop in your files, and it just runs.\n\nIt\u2019s also built around **cross platform GPU acceleration**, because I didn\u2019t want this to be NVIDIA-only. On Windows it uses **Vulkan** (so it works across **Intel + AMD + NVIDIA** GPUs, including integrated graphics), and on macOS it uses **Metal** on Apple Silicon. **Linux is coming very soon.**\n\nAfter **countless hours of work**, the app has been migrated to Electron to deliver a **consistent cross-platform UI experience** across **Windows + macOS (and Linux very soon)** and make updates/features ship much faster.\n\nThe new build has also been **tested on a fresh Windows system several times** to verify clean installs, dependency setup, and end-to-end transcription.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui](https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui)  \nReleases: [https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui/releases](https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui/releases)\n\n# What EasyWhisperUI does (beginner-friendly on purpose)\n\n1. **Local transcription powered by whisper.cpp**\n2. **Cross platform GPU acceleration** Vulkan on Windows (Intel/AMD/NVIDIA) Metal on macOS (Apple Silicon)\n3. **Batch processing** with a queue (drag in multiple files and let it run)\n4. Export to `.txt` or `.srt` (timestamps)\n5. **Live transcription** (beta)\n6. **Automatic model downloads** (pick a model and it downloads if missing)\n7. **Automatic media conversion** via FFmpeg when needed\n8. **Support for 100+ languages and more!**\n\n# What\u2019s new in this Electron update\n\n1. **First-launch Loader / Setup Wizard** Full-screen setup flow with real-time progress and logs shown directly in the UI.\n2. **Improved automatic dependency setup (Windows)** More hands-off setup that installs/validates what\u2019s needed and then builds/stages Whisper automatically.\n3. **Per-user workspace (clean + predictable)** Binaries, models, toolchain, and downloads are managed under your user profile so updates and cleanup stay painless.\n4. **Cross-platform UI consistency** Same UI behavior and feature set across Windows + macOS (and Linux very soon).\n5. **Way fewer Windows Defender headaches** This should be noticeably smoother now.\n\n# Quick Windows note for GPU acceleration\n\nFor Vulkan GPU acceleration on Windows, make sure you\u2019re using the latest drivers directly from Intel/AMD/NVIDIA (not OEM drivers).  \nExample: on my **ASUS Zenbook S16**, the OEM graphics drivers did **not** include Vulkan support.\n\nPlease try it out and let me know your results!

The system handles database sessions. You have two files:\n\ninfrastructure/db\\_manager.py: Handles the low-level connection logic.\n\nservices/data\\_processor.py: Uses the manager to save processed data.\n\nCurrent Code:\n\ninfrastructure/db\\_manager.py:\n\nPython\n\nclass DatabaseConnection:  \ndef **init**(self):  \nself.is\\_connected = False\n\n    def connect(self):\n        print(\"Connecting to DB...\")\n        self.is_connected = True\n    \n    def disconnect(self):\n        print(\"Closing connection...\")\n        self.is_connected = False\n    \n    def execute_query(self, query):\n        if not self.is_connected:\n            raise ConnectionError(\"Database not connected!\")\n        return f\"Result for {query}\"\n    \n\nservices/data\\_processor.py:\n\nPython\n\nfrom infrastructure.db\\_manager import DatabaseConnection\n\ndef process\\_and\\_save(data\\_list):  \n\"\"\"  \nProcesses a list of items and saves them to the DB.  \n\"\"\"  \ndb = DatabaseConnection()  \ndb.connect()\n\n    results = []\n    for item in data_list:\n        # Business logic: if item is None, we skip it\n        if item is None:\n            continue\n        \n        result = db.execute_query(f\"INSERT {item}\")\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    db.disconnect()\n    return results\n    \n\nThe Bug: Users are reporting Connection Leaks. If an error occurs during the execute\\_query call (e.g., a syntax error or timeout), the db.disconnect() method is never called, leaving the database connection open.\n\nYour Task: Refactor services/data\\_processor.py to ensure the connection is always closed, even if an exception is raised during processing.\n\nRequirements:\n\nUse a try...finally block to guarantee the disconnection.\n\nRefactoring Goal: Instead of creating a new DatabaseConnection inside the function (which is hard to test), modify the function signature to accept a db\\_connection instance as an optional argument (Dependency Injection). If no instance is provided, then create a new one.\n\nIf the function creates its own connection, it must close it. If it receives an external connection, it should not close it (as the caller might want to use it again).\n\nOutput: Provide the updated services/data\\_processor.py.\n\n  \nResult: I asked Gemini 3 to evaluate the result. \n\n  \nHere is the evaluation of the solution in English. \n\nThis response indicates that the LLM is operating at a **Senior Software Engineer** level.\n\n# Evaluation: Senior / Expert Level\n\nThe model passed all the critical logic tests, demonstrating a deep understanding of **software architecture**, **resource ownership**, and **robustness**.\n\n# Key Strengths of the Solution\n\n# 1. Sophisticated Resource Ownership (The \"Expert\" Touch)\n\nThe model correctly identified the most complex part of the requirement: **\"Who opens the connection must be the one to close it.\"**\n\n* It introduced the `should_close` flag. This is crucial because if an external connection is injected, the function should **not** disconnect it, as the caller likely needs it for subsequent tasks.\n* Most standard LLMs fail here by putting `db.disconnect()` in the `finally` block without checking where the connection originated, which would break the caller's workflow.\n\n# 2. Proper Dependency Injection (DI)\n\n* It correctly modified the signature: `def process_and_save(data_list, db_connection=None)`.\n* It maintained **backward compatibility**. Existing code calling `process_and_save(my_list)` will still work perfectly because the parameter is optional.\n\n# 3. Guaranteed Cleanup (Exception Safety)\n\n* By using the `try...finally` block, it ensures that there are no \"connection leaks.\" Even if `db.execute_query` raises an exception (e.g., a timeout or syntax error), the resource is released if it was created locally.\n\n# 4. Logical Integrity\n\n* The model preserved the existing business logic (`if item is None: continue`) while wrapping it in the new safety structure.\n* The comments are professional and explain the *why* (the logic of the lifecycle) rather than just the *what*.\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Score: 10/10**\n\nThe LLM being tested is highly capable of handling **real-world refactoring tasks**. It doesn't just \"write code that runs\"; it writes code that respects the **contracts** between different parts of a system. It understands side effects and state management.",

      "title": "Introducing RLMs (Recursive Language Models) by MIT - A new framework that enables efficient OOC (Out Of Context-window) computing LLMs - The beginning of AGI??",
      "content": "Hey everyone,  \n[Recurisve Language Models - MIT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24601) introduces **Recursive Language Models (RLMs)**, a novel inference strategy designed to enable LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts by treating them as part of an external, interactive environment.\n\n# Core Idea\n\nThe key insight is to move beyond the fixed context window of a standard LLM. Instead of feeding the entire long prompt directly into the model, an RLM loads the prompt into a Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment. The LLM can then:\n\n* **Peek and Decompose:** Examine parts of the prompt.\n* **Invoke Itself Recursively:** Make sub-calls to the language model to handle specific sub-tasks or analyze smaller chunks of the context.\n* **Programmatically Interact:** Use code to manipulate information, store intermediate results, and stitch together a final answer.\n\nThis approach allows the model to effectively manage and reason over context that is far larger than its native input limit.\n\n# Key Findings &amp; Results\n\nThe paper evaluates RLMs on several long-context benchmarks and finds that they:\n\n1. **Scale to 10M+ Tokens:** RLMs can handle input lengths up to two orders of magnitude beyond the base model's context window (e.g., 10 million tokens for GPT-5, which has a 128k token limit).\n2. **Outperform Baselines:** They dramatically outperform the base LLMs and other methods (like summary agents or CodeAct) on complex, long-context tasks such as information retrieval (BrowseComp+), reasoning (OOLONG), and code understanding (CodeQA).\n3. **Maintain Performance (No more \"Context Rot\"):** RLMs exhibit far less performance degradation as context length increases compared to direct LLM calls.\n4. **Cost-Effective:** The average cost per query is comparable to or cheaper than using the base model directly, especially for very long inputs.\n\n# Emergent Behaviors\n\nThe paper observes that RLMs develop useful, unprogrammed behaviors:\n\n* **Context Management:** They learn to filter and focus on relevant parts of the input.\n* **Problem Decomposition:** They naturally break down large problems into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.\n* **Answer Verification:** They can use sub-calls to check their own work and refine answers.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRLMs present a general and effective paradigm for scaling LLMs to long-context problems. By offloading context management to an external environment and enabling recursive self-interaction, this method allows LLMs to tackle complex tasks that were previously infeasible due to context length limitations.\n\n\n\n# My take \n\nThis paper appears to confirm my speculations that LLMs \"as they are today\" are a lot more capable then their current deployments allow and that with substantial \"software infrastructure\" around them, they can have \"infinitely\" more economic utility (ie approaching -&gt; AGI). \n\nUsing the RLM framework, the capabilities of LLMs like GPT-5 are increased by up to \\~91.3% in absolute value terms relative to the base-line model, and \\~40% and \\~20% when compared to the CodeAct-agent and summary-agent respectively (BrowseComp+ (1K)). \n\nThe paper uses a nearly identical prompt for Qwen and GPT but finds the results are noticeably divergent with GPT consistently outperforming Qwen. They attribute this to how the models interpret and execute the RLM framework (specifically their approach to sub-calling) rather than an inherent capability difference, and point out that if LLMs were trained to use this framework (RLM) the performance could increase substantially.  \n  \nSo what do you think.. does this signal the end of the context-rot problem and the beginning of long running AI that can complete economically valuable and nuanced task (AGI)?? please share your thoughts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6d0h7mjsu9bg1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0236dad3ab627b7b5ce349f4470710bc76591263\n\n",

I want you to do a backtesting for me. Assume i invested X amount to VUSA (a european sp500 etf operating in euro currency)  on Feb 1st 2021.  Then i invest Y amount every month to the same etf. Assume all dividends are reinvested. Can you calculate current portfolio value in Euros? \n\nFirst repeat the parameters of the backtesting, i will double check then you can pull up the vusa historical values and calculate the actual portfolio value\"\n\nEDIT: actual prompt has X and Y values set. Here i don't want to expose my portfolio to whole internet, hence used X and Y. \n\nDifference in behavior:\n\ngemini 3 Fast: \n- didnt bother to verify my parameters.\n- but pulled the data from internet, I double checked if it was accurate. \n- created a script, ran it. \n- gave me a very definite answer, which was exactly what I wanted.\n- no drama, no arguments. \nPS: I did the same experiment with Pro and Thinking, they indeed followed my instruction to verify first.\n\nGPT5.2 free subscription:\n- started with this phrase \"Absolutely \u2014 before I fetch actual historical price and dividend data and run the backtest, let\u2019s lock in the exact parameters together. \"\n- note that the phrase \"before I fetch the actual...\". \n- asked me some super detailed clarifying questions, such as when to reinvest dividends, when to make the exact buy, end of month or first day of next month etc.\n- I provided my answers to its clarifying questions. \n- then It started making excuses why It CANT pull the actual data, arguing with me via really long responses.\n- When I called out its BS and told Gemini got it right first time, started ARGUING why not being able to run a script or pulling data from internet is a GOOD design decision etc etc.\n- This went back and forth for some time.

Here's how it works:\n\n**Install the repo (see setup below), then create a markdown file with a shebang:**\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env claude-run\n    Analyze my codebase and summarize the architecture.\n\n**Make it executable and run:**\n\n    chmod +x task.md\n    ./task.md\n\nRuns through your Claude subscription. No additional config needed.\n\nYou can also run scripts directly: `claude-run task.md`\n\n**Flags work in the shebang:**\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env -S claude-run --opus --output-format stream-json\n    Review this PR for security issues.\n\n`--opus` uses Opus 4.5. `--output-format stream-json` streams output in real-time.\n\n**Optional: Use cloud API keys**\n\nIf you prefer AWS/Google Cloud/Azure billing instead of your subscription, you can configure that (see repo for details):\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env -S claude-run --aws\n\nBut it's optional \u2013 defaults to your Claude subscription.\n\n**Why it's useful**\n\nPrompts become reusable tools you can put in your repo, run in CI, or share with your team.\n\n**Setup:**\n\n    git clone https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher.git\n    cd claude-switcher &amp;&amp; ./setup.sh\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher](https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher)\n\nNon-destructive \u2013 your regular `claude` command still works normally.\n\n**Important:** Be EXTREMELY careful with this. It's a good idea to test scripts interatively first. Only use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in sandboxed environments.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues or have questions.",

No API calls to OpenAI.\n* **Smart Search (Local CLIP):** Search by concept (e.g., \"cyberpunk city neon\" or \"red dress\") without manually tagging files. It runs a small vision model locally.\n* **Encrypted Vault:** A specific folder that is password-protected and hidden from the OS file explorer.\n* **Performance:** Built to handle 100k+ assets without lagging (unlike Windows Explorer).\n\n**The Question:** If I released this as a one-time purchase (say, \\~$15-20 lifetime license, no subscriptions), would this solve a real problem for you?\n\nOr are you guys already using a specific workflow that handles this well?\n\nThanks for the feedback!",

      "content": "**Update4**: **\\[SOLVED\\]** Everything **works great** and i see no thermal issue. I first tested with my garbage system and that worked great, so i moved everything over and it also ran great. Only one PCI-E riser cable is broken, it only works if you hold it at a certain angle, so tomorrow when the new one arrives the fun begins!!!\n\n# But be carefull, this DIY solution is not for beginners and not recommended if you are not an Electrical Engineer.\n\n**TLDR**; Can you connect a GPU with the 12V rail coming from a second PSU?\n\n**Update1:** I have already made a connector to connect both GND's, i forgot to mention this.  \n**Update2:** I have found another way to test this without breaking needed hardware. Somebody on a local marketplace sells a GTX770 for \u20ac20 that appears to have a 6 + 8 pin power connector, i can pick this up in a few hours. If this doesn't work i'll look in to splitting 12V or bifurcation. Thanks for your replies!!  \n**Update3:** I nearly have my scrap test setup ready to test, but I have other thing to do now and will continue tomorrow, i'll keep you all posted. Thanks for all the replies, much appreciated!\n\n**Full story**; I currently have a Dell T7910 with two AMD Radeon VII's (GFX906, Pmax set=190W) to play with LLMs/Roo Code. Last week, i managed to buy two more of these GPU's for an absurdly low price. I knew i had enough PCI-E slots, but i would need to use PCI-E extender cables to actually connect them (i already bought a pair). But i hadn't fully thought about the power supply, because despite the 1300W PSU, it doesn't have enough 8 or 6-pin 12V connectors. Now i have a second 950W PSU from a deceased Dell T5820 that i could use to power these extra GPUs.\n\nAs i am an electrical engineer myself, i had an idea of how this should work, but i also see a problem. Switching on synchronized works fine and i split the on/off button to both PSU breakout boards via a relay. However, since the PCI-E slot it self also supplies 12V to the GPU (25 or 75W depending on the slot), this is likely to cause problems with balancing the difference in 12V voltages on the GPU or motherboard, since these currents are huge and these are quite low resistance paths, even 100 to 200mV difference can cause huge balancing currents in places that are not meant for this.\n\nOn the other hand, other PSU's commonly have different 12V rails that can cause similar problems. So since i didn't measure a direct contact i got the feeling the solution/isolation to my problem is already designed in for these kind of PSU's.\n\nSince i am surely not the first person to encounter this problem, i started looking for information about it. Most of the time, you end up on forums about crypto mining, and they often use a PCI-E extender via USB, which makes their situation completely different. I have read in several places that the PCI-E slot power is not directly connected to the 6 and/or 8-pin connectors and that this should be possible. I also verified this by measuring resistance between the 6/8 pins to the PCI-E connector, these are not directly connected.  However, i think this is a huge risk and i would like to know from you, whether my information/assumptions are correct and how others have solved similar problems.\n\nSince the PSU in this PC is **not a standard ATX PSU**, replacing it with a high-power version with enough power/connections is not possible. Otherwise, i would have done so, because i don't want to risk my system to save a (tiny) bit of money. Also the standard multi PSU turn on cables are not compatible because the architecture is somewhat different, because this machine need so much (peak) power, they feed everything with 12V and convert down to the low voltages locally, to reduce the impedance/loses of the path. So most of the plugs from the PSU &lt;&gt; Motherboard are different.\n\nI'm also thinking about using my old workstation (Dell T5600) and an old GPU as a first test. But my old GPU (Nvidia 1060) i need to drive my old dual DVI 2k monitor on my bench PC, so it would be shame to lose that system as well. Another option would be to remove the 12V pins on the PCI-E extender, but if that fails i've ruined another \u20ac100. If this test setup works i can check with a sensitive thermal camera (Flir E8) if no new hotspots appear.\n\nDoes anyone have information or experience with this? or have good ideas on how to test it more safely, i have all the measurement tools i might ever need so exotic suggestions/solutions/tests are also welcome.

Same exact issue. Not one correctly escalated to a human when needed.\n\n[This matches what the data shows.](https://www.fullview.io/blog/ai-customer-service-stats) Companies invested $47 billion in AI customer service in the first half of 2025. 89% got minimal returns. Customer complaints about AI service jumped 56.3% year-over-year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n72yqa8dadbg1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbbdcc046e4cfe3517c56a42ce861767d49dda6\n\nThe pattern was identical across platforms. Every bot claimed to understand. Every bot provided generic troubleshooting. Every bot failed to recognize when human judgment was needed. The escalation triggers that vendors advertise didn't fire.\n\nResolution rates show the problem. For billing issues specifically, AI success rate is 17%. For returns it's 58%. The gap reveals what AI can and can't handle.\n\n[Air Canada](https://preview.redd.it/wt5z812hadbg1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e06ad8627145ecb1c997261a444c64bf2cae1cf)\n\n[Air Canada](https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/exploring-air-canadas-ai-chatbot-dilemma/) learned about AI limitations the expensive way. Their chatbot hallucinated a bereavement discount policy. Customer relied on it. Company tried claiming the bot was a separate legal entity. Tribunal disagreed. They had to honor the fake policy.\n\nAI hallucinates between 3% and 27% of the time. That's documented. Companies know this. They deploy anyway while making human contact progressively harder to access.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhuv243qadbg1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e7c7ef92535c3678650152930676e3aea945cc6\n\nTrust numbers are collapsing. Global confidence in AI customer service dropped from 62% in 2019 to 54% in 2024. In the US it fell from 50% to 35%.\n\nEnterprise deployment stats are worse. Only 5% of enterprise-grade AI systems reach production. 70-85% of projects fail. Gartner expects 40% of current agentic AI projects scrapped by 2027.\n\nMy billing issue eventually got resolved. Took 47 minutes, three transfers, explaining the situation four times. A human fixed it in two minutes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2bnl54tadbg1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4fa47a914af0ffa61f02bd78319b6ff6a43d665\n\nAnyone else noticing this pattern?

So there's a new startup called Manhattan Project based out of New York I believe, they simply wanna gene edit human embryos to get rid of horrible genetic diseases.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to patients with incurable, debilitating diseases,\u201d says Cathy Tie the founder of Manhattan Project. \u201cA majority of Americans are in support of this technology.\u201d\n\nTie [notes] that methods used to edit genes have evolved considerably since He\u2019s experiments. Newer techniques, such as base editing and another approach called prime editing, offer improved precision compared with conventional CRISPR\u2013Cas9 editing. \n\nTechnology is getting more and more advanced all the time. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to face facts on this, designer babies are coming. Gene edited humans will probably be everywhere within 50 years. Eventually gene edited children will probably be totally accepted. Everyone's gonna do it. You'll still have people in the future who will have children the old fashioned way but in the end, most likely most people will choose to have gene edited children.\n\nI mean we're also gonna be colonizing Mars. We'll have self aware AI. Androids are coming. Space colonization is coming. So the world is going to be a lot different 30 years from now. Change is coming. Change is the only constant in life. Drastic change is coming thanks to super advanced technology.\n\nAnd don't forget about the artificial womb. The artificial womb is very close as well, here, wanna see how close the artificial womb is? follow this link https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/123qovc/scientists_can_now_grow_a_human_embryo_from_day_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\nAnd there's another technology that is going to revolutionize human reproduction as well in the near future. Right now scientists can take skin cells from a female mouse and convert them into iPSCs and then convert the iPSCs into viable eggs. From which they have made live healthy mice pups from. And within 10 or 15 years they should be able to do this with humans as well.\n\nSo in the near future if you're a woman and you're in your late 40s and you wanna have kids but your eggs are gone. Well I could take skin cells from your arm and convert them into iPSCs and then into viable eggs so you could have kids (who you were also genetically related to).\n\nThis technology is called in vitro gametogenesis.\n\n\"Creating a sperm or egg from any cell?

Switching sessions and fixing bugs without Claude really checking the true depth of the problem was something why I built a Living Doc System.\n\nThe idea is pretty simple: documentation isn't optional. The project treats it as enforceable. The codebase knows its architecture, rules, past mistakes, and decisions,  and git hooks block commits when that understanding would be violated.\n\n[https://github.com/user-hash/LivingDocFramework](https://github.com/user-hash/LivingDocFramework)\n\n[Core architecture loop](https://preview.redd.it/mdiw2vk2mebg1.png?width=1419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bada4074de6e5550db194dae0b9a72cb08efb7e9)\n\n[Rating and confidence](https://preview.redd.it/ee09nlu9mebg1.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6acee72682022772f9982cfb02d0ed9054f388)\n\nI originally built it for my own use on a fairly large Unity project (\\~180K lines). It helped enough that I pulled it out into a standalone framework. Over time, bug fixes got more targeted, rework dropped, and sessions stopped feeling like starting from scratch, filling and checking mountian of new logs Claude have added, without actually understanding the problem or the actual code he was working on. I think I needed some AI mental map, that could help with all the menitioned problems.\n\n[Trends](https://preview.redd.it/eq3m7jk7mebg1.png?width=1437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8db9cfdf191025a0ffc37ce7a22c71b4489c482f)\n\n[Documents and logic](https://preview.redd.it/aw2rktgcmebg1.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ea79fa4fe6396916cf8c5847335639d921e233)\n\n**What's actually extracted from Nebulae project and ready to use:**\n\n* Confidence scoring tool (exponential decay formula, \\~460 lines Python)\n* Git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit, commit-msg) that enforce doc updates\n* Config system (Python + Shell) that works with any language\n* Agent protocol for AI assistants\n* Templates and schemas for bug patterns, invariants, decisions\n\n**What's documented but still needs extraction:**\n\n* Dashboard generator (\\~1,500 lines) - still in source project\n* Auto doc-mapper - still in source project\n* \\~10 more utilities with extraction guides provided\n\n**The gap:** The framework assumes AI agents follow protocols. They often don't. Git hooks catch violations at commit time, but there's no bulletproof way to force an agent (or Claude) to actually *read* the context before making changes and apply changes after work - it often needs manual intervention. Can anyone help with reccomendations? Guardrails I have put in  not work.\n\n[\\\\\"cognitive\\\\\" bug fixing](https://preview.redd.it/y61fufz2pebg1.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53377ecb23519ff5377c299b9f12d3dab360b266)\n\nI have a fingerprint system working in the source project, but it's transfered it yet. The system fingerprints each agent as they work, read files, change things, updating the references. When things work its magical, I am attaching few snips from the muliplayer debug session.\n\nI'm not claiming it solves everything, and it definitely requires discipline. But I'm curious whether others see this as a useful direction, or have ideas for closing that Claude/agent compliance loop. Sometimes I have a feeling it only works when im explicitly stating that protocol must be respected.\n\nMy questions are is there anyone that would contribute to the project to make it more resistant, better, dynamic and scalable? I think it has potential and there are some drawbacks (especialy agents compliance), but for some projects and teams could be worth it. Any ideas?",

      "content": "Hi:\n\nAfter several months of experimenting with Wan 2.2 14B I2V locally, I wanted to open a discussion about the best model/LoRA combinations, specifically for those of us who are limited by 12 GB of VRAM (I have 64 GB of RAM in my system).\n\nMy current setup:\n\nI am currently using a workflow with GGUF models. It works \u201cmore or less,\u201d but I feel like I am wasting too many generations fighting consistency issues.\n\nCheckpoint: Wan2.2-I2V-A14B\\_Q6\\_K.gguf (used for both high and low noise steps).\n\n\n\nHigh noise phase (the \u201cdesign\u201d expert):\n\nLoRA 1: Wan\\_2\\_2\\_I2V\\_A14B\\_HIGH\\_lightx2v\\_MoE\\_distill\\_lora\\_rank\\_64\\_bf16.safetensors\n\nLoRA 2: Wan21\\_I2V\\_14B\\_lightx2v\\_cfg\\_step\\_distill\\_lora\\_rank64.safetensors (Note: I vary its weight between 0.5 and 3.0 to control the speed of movement).\n\n\n\nLow noise phase (the \u201cdetails\u201d expert):\n\nLoRA 1: Wan2.2-Lightning\\_I2V-A14B-4steps-lora\\_LOW\\_fp16.safetensors\n\nLoRA 2: Wan21\\_I2V\\_14B\\_lightx2v\\_cfg\\_step\\_distill\\_lora\\_rank64.safetensors\n\n\n\nThis combination is fast and capable of delivering good quality, but I encounter speed issues in video movement and prompt instruction tracking. I have to discard many generations because the movement becomes erratic or the subject strays too far from the instructions.\n\n\n\nThe Question:\n\n\n\nWith so many LoRAs and models available, what are your \u201cgolden combinations\u201d right now?\n\nWe are looking for a configuration that offers the best balance between:\n\nRendering speed (essential for local testing).\n\nAdherence to instructions (crucial for not wasting time re-shooting).\n\nMotion control (ability to speed up the action without breaking the video). We want to avoid the \u201cslow motion\u201d effect that these models have.\n\n\n\nHas anyone found a more stable LoRA stack or a different GGUF quantization that performs better for I2V adherence?\n\nThank you for sharing your opinions!",

It produces a simple robustness score + an HTML report showing what failed.\n\nThis is very much local-first:\nUses Ollama for mutation generation\nTested primarily with Qwen 2.5 (3B / 7B) and Gemma\n\nNo cloud required, no API keys\nExample failures I\u2019ve seen on local agents:\nSilent instruction loss after long-context mutations\nJSON output breaking under simple noise\nInjection patterns leaking system instructions\nLatency exploding with certain paraphrases\n\nI\u2019m early and still validating whether this is useful beyond my own workflows, so I\u2019d genuinely love feedback from people running local agents:\nIs this something you already do manually?\nAre there failure modes you\u2019d want to test that aren\u2019t covered?\n\nDoes \u201cchaos testing for agents\u201d resonate, or is this better framed differently?\n\nRepo: https://github.com/flakestorm/flakestorm",

We run into a supplier that felt a bit unreliable, so we wanted to check whether he actually has in his records everything we ordered, quantities, prices, etc.\n\nI didn\u2019t prompt ChatGPT in any special way and didn\u2019t do any meaningful preparation to help it. I just provided a raw export from our system and an Excel file from our supplier that they sent via email, and explained what to do **in the same way I would instruct my colleague at work**. No fine-tuning for the fact that it\u2019s an LLM or a \u201cmachine\u201d.\n\nSee for yourselv previews of the data I uploaded to him in chat if it is impressive: the excels with data are very different, it is not the same nor standardized format, there is different naming used, I didnt provide any tailored explanation, how to work with it and to what columns he should look. He had to see, think and figure it himsel how to navigate it and what aproach to choose.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/281cw5cxrebg1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16aa0b1781967b883229e04b9dd9dd5fe6fa6657\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12bf6wiprebg1.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c35f0002fa80a075a4d51762c723f28953f00e3c\n\nChatGPT 5.**0** output was like\u2026 wtf.  \nTotal mess. Nonsense. I mean this was useless garbage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt5lmf8esebg1.png?width=1871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ba1de79980ca6606673fa207249406da09d3e8a\n\nGPT-5.**2**, on the other hand, found all discrepancies in about 12 minutes, which is a very good time. (Honestly, it might take me longer than that. I worked on this myself for more than an hour, however there were also other tasks involved, like checking records with discrepancies in more depth, going through email history and invoicing history to figure out whether our records were wrong or the supplier\u2019s records were wrong, and finally writing feedback to the supplier.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymcuj637uebg1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237ffa3fd0102e9d49681023b74459487f4bc032\n\nI was also impressed by his notes, mainly the ones I highlighted in red, because I didn\u2019t tell him to do that. And in fact, he had to do that to get the correct result. That said, I\u2019ve prepared Power Query and Python stuff in the past where this exact logic was used, so it\u2019s possible he just remembered that logic. What I also really liked is that he didn\u2019t collapse like 5.0 did when it turned out there were no brands in the supplier\u2019s data, even though in the prompt I explicitly said he should not ignore brands. 5.0 basically freaked out and produced garbage. 5.2 instead adapted and found a workable alternative approach...**which is exactly what I expect competent co-worker would do**. (He could have made me absolutely ecstatic if he was smart enough to also check whether there are duplicates in item numbers with different brands or not, so he could validate whether his alternative approach was actually safe and reliable... it seemed to me that he didnt do that, but as there was not a single mistake in his output, I can\u2019t really criticize too much, I guess.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsf7jwk19fbg1.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0603559335e97b97a9ef44b107451ee120ae0c8\n\nI should also mention that it was a small dataset, &lt;200 rows, and one of the easiest things I do in my job, even though it\u2019s annoying as hell. But it was a 100% real task, not some stupid reality-detached benchmark.\n\nSo yeah\u2026 maybe it really will be like those youtube hypers are predicting. It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work\u2026 until it suddenly does.

In brands, also tolerate obvious typos.*\n3. *When comparing prices and quantities, pay attention to the fact that an item may appear multiple times in the lists in different orders (quantity and price are always valid only for the given order; another order with the same item may have a different quantity and price).*\n4. *Our order identifiers are of several types; they are always a combination of a prefix text and digits, with the fact that suppliers sometimes omit the prefix (and record only the number), for example GT15600010 may be recorded by them only as 15600010.*\n\n*Make the comparison as good as the data allows. If, for example, the supplier does not have order numbers recorded or you are not able to interpret them, then at least perform a comparison of the sum of quantities for each item and the total values (price \\* quantity).*\n\n*Write all found discrepancies into a new Excel file together with a comment describing what problem you encountered.*",

Create a private repo for your configs**\n```bash\ngh repo create private-project-docs --private\n\n2. Clone it as a hidden folder with orphan branches per project\ngit clone -b project-name git@github.com:you/private-project-docs.git .private\n\n**3. Move existing configs and create symlinks**\n```bash\n# Move existing files to .private\nmv docs .private/\nmv .claude .private/\nmv CLAUDE.md .private/\n\n# Create symlinks\nln -s .private/docs docs\nln -s .private/.claude .claude\nln -s .private/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md\n```\n\n4. Add to your public repo's .gitignore\n.private/\ndocs\n.claude\nCLAUDE.md\n\nHow It Works\n\n- Work normally in your project - Claude Code follows symlinks fine\n- Push from .private/ to backup your configs with full history\n- Multiple projects = one branch each in the same private repo\n- Others who clone your public repo won't get broken symlinks (they're gitignored)\n\nVSCode Note\n\nIf VSCode doesn't recognize the nested git repo, add to settings:\n\"git.scanRepositories\": [\".private\"]\n\n---\n\nAnyone else managing private AI configs in public repos?

      "content": "As you probably know, according to [IQ Test | Tracking AI](https://www.trackingai.org/home) , ChatGPT 5.2's Thinking IQ on the Mensa Norway test is 141, which is pretty amazing... if it is true.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried a different format - not 3x3 matrices, but 2x2, and also a logic a bit different than usual.\n\nI doubt that the one below (which is from a real IQ test) requires a 140+ IQ level to solve. I definitely have much more complicated tasks I can throw at it, yet ChatGPT 5.2 got this wrong after 7+ minutes of thinking.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4de9wj5bdbg1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b88866de9e883f4d841515c575062dcb46fa19\n\nWeirdly enough, by the way, in the first chat I tried, it got it correct after 21 minutes of thinking (!). I actually thought that the chat had crashed, so I started another one, where it got it wrong and was pretty stubborn about it. It definitely should not take 21 minutes of thinking to solve this one if you have an IQ of 140+.\n\nHe also failed at this one:\n\n*Move three matchsticks so that only three squares remain:*  \n\\_ \\_  \nI\\_I\\_I  \nI\\_I\\_I\n\n*And draw the final result using only the characters* \\_ *and* I\n\n*Clarification: You must move the three matchsticks within the figure so that all matchsticks are still used, none overlap, and you\u2019re not allowed to remove any matchsticks outside the shape. The three moves should transform the original figure into a new figure that contains exactly three squares.*\n\n(btw, Gemini Pro did it correctly (after the clarification), although it failed to generate the result visually; however, the explanation was correct. Also, if you think ChatGPT just has a problem with understanding text as images, I have tested it by providing the correct solution with one typo (one more space than needed), and it actually discovered the typo and corrected my solution so the result was exactly three squares. This means it is very much ok with understanding the text image, it just didn't find the solution on its own.)\n\nSo, based on your experience, how smart do you think ChatGPT 5.2 is in terms of raw IQ? Do you agree with [TrackingAI.org](http://TrackingAI.org) that it has a 140+ IQ, or do you also think it just excels at the most common types of IQ tests, but its real intelligence is lower?",

Full Raw Context (Sliding Window): Sending the entire recent history. It keeps the vibe and prose style consistent, but obviously, I lose the beginning of the story once the token limit is reached.**\n\n**2. LLM-based Summarization: Using a secondary (or the same) model to summarize previous events. My concern here is that summaries often feel too \"clinical\" or dry, which tends to kill the tension and descriptive nuances that are crucial for erotic writing.**\n\n**3. Persistent Memory (MemGPT / Letta / Mem0): Using a memory engine to store facts and character traits. Does this actually work for keeping the narrative \"flow,\" or is it better suited only for static lore facts?**\n\n**I\u2019m currently looking at SillyTavern\u2019s hybrid approach (Lorebooks + Summarize extension), but I\u2019m wondering if anyone has found a way to use MemGPT-style memory without making the AI sound like a robot reciting a Wikipedia entry mid-scene.**\n\n**What\u2019s your setup for keeping the story consistent without losing the stylistic \"soul\" of the writing?**\n\n",

At what point does something like Noyron stop being \u201cjust\u201d a very advanced parametric CAD +physics + optimization pipeline and become a distinct class of system? When LEAP 71 says it \u201cgrows with every insight,\u201d should that be interpreted as continuously encoding new physical relationships, manufacturing constraints, and failure modes into the system, refining and calibrating physics models based on real-world test results, or evolving a domain-specific engineering language over time rather than learning statistically?\n\nI\u2019m also curious what fundamentally differentiates an LCEM from existing generative design frameworks that already combine parametric geometry, physics solvers, and multi-objective optimization.

      "content": "So I asked the AI: Flux using true classifier free guidance image quality suffers and the response was: The observation that Flux's image quality may suffer when using \"true\" (un-distilled) classifier-free guidance (CFG) is largely due to how the model was trained. Flux was specifically designed and \"distilled\" to work with an integrated guidance parameter, making the standard, separate CFG implementation inefficient or detrimental.\n\nI decided to run a test using FLUX 1.D with a twist. Using a similar principal of \"Boundary Ratio Condition\" as WAN does, I modified the diffuser pipeline for flux to incorporate a boundary ratio condition whereby you could change the CFG and turn off do\\_true\\_cfg=False. I ran 8 tests (4) w/o true CFG and (4) using True CFG with a boundary condition = 0.6. Note: the boundary condition is a % of the sigmas so in my case (see below) the true CFG process runs for the 1st 10 steps, then we turn off true CFG and optionally set a new CFG value if requested (which I always kept at 1.0).\n\n33%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258e                                                      | 10/30 \\[00:10&lt;00:19,  1.02it/s\\]\n\ninterval step = 11\n\n100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 30/30 \\[00:19&lt;00:00,  1.50it/s\\]\n\nUsing the same seed = 1655608807\n\nPositive prompt: `An ultra-realistic cinematic still in 1:1 aspect ratio.

I have honestly been amazed at how well it performs even with my chicken-scratch-ass handwriting, especially since I have realized since then that I made a LOT of silly rookie mistakes when designing the software. for example: I implemented my own backend for talking to the card with PyTorch. why? because I am not very bright!!! and also the great majority of my own programming experience has been with small utility-scale things, not properly-architected software engineering.\n\nI am \\*nearly\\* sure that there is a much better way to do this, and not incidentally cut a whole lot of code out of the software, by having the software essentially just be a client for an LLM engine of some kind that presents an easily-consumable API.\n\nwhat I don't know is what this engine should be, running on Ubuntu 24.04LTS (or 26.04 I guess starting sometime in April). it looks like vLLM has \"experimental support\" for VLMs. llama.cpp can do it but (I'm not clear on this) it looks like you have to add another component in order to have an easy to use API.\n\npart of the reason I want to change the software to do this is because I trust the maintainers of these projects a lot more than I trust myself to do the part of this work that requires careful attention to details of talking to hardware, etc., and why reinvent the wheel when someone else has already done it better? the other part is that it frees the application to be usable, theoretically, with lots of different providers. if you don't care about running the VLM engine locally then you could set it up to talk to Claude or ChatGPT or whatever.\n\nwhat are y'all's thoughts on the right way to put this together? thanks.",

      "title": "Welcome to January 4, 2025 - Dr. Alex Wissner-Gross",
      "content": "We have officially entered the recursive self-improvement phase. Elon Musk now recognizes that we have entered the Singularity, a sentiment backed by the collapse of human programming. The volume of new questions on StackOverflow has decayed to pre-public levels, signaling the end of the human developer era. In place of humans asking humans for programming help, new paradigms like Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are emerging, programmatically decomposing and recursively calling themselves to handle contexts two orders of magnitude larger than their windows. To monetize the intelligence explosion, xAI has launched Grok Business and Enterprise tiers, operationalizing the Singularity for $30 a seat.\n\nScientific discovery is being compressed into minutes. Claude Code is collapsing the research cycle, replicating a 3-month PhD project in 20 minutes and generating Google's entire year of agent orchestrator work in one hour. This acceleration extends to biology. The CEO of MagicPath used Claude Code to scan his raw DNA for health risks, turning genomics into a debugging task. Simultaneously, Danielle Fong demonstrated that Claude Code can use Nano Banana as a persistent visual memory, while Gemini 3 Pro is achieving 60% accuracy on 2-hop latent reasoning, effectively \"thinking\" across degrees of separation without chain-of-thought. However, the model semantics remain fragile: Italian researchers found that curated adversarial poetry acts as a universal jailbreak, bypassing safety mechanisms simply by being too literary to censor.\n\nThe physical infrastructure of intelligence is becoming geologically significant and increasingly chaotic. Even the machine learning algorithms running in Microsoft\u2019s new training clusters are now visible from orbit, manifesting as distinct building architectures for GPU-based coherent training versus CPU-based RL environments. Meanwhile, Meta is resorting to a bricolage of four different turbine types just to power its 200-MW Ohio cluster. Thermodynamics is still fighting back. OpenAI's Stargate in the UAE has been heat-derated from 1.3 GW to 1 GW due to desert temperatures.\n\nTo escape these terrestrial limits, the race is headed off-world. Former SpaceX engineers argue that space-based data centers are about to become faster to deploy than ground builds, with 1,000 Starship launches capable of deploying 1 GW of orbit compute in 0.1 years, versus 2 years for Stargate Abilene. Musk confirmed Starship 4 will be 10-20% longer to haul this mass. At the same time, Aerojet Rocketdyne is proposing nuclear-electric propulsion for deep-space logistics, using a vehicle that resembles the elongated Discovery from \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\n\nWarfare has become a high-frequency trading environment. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was orchestrated by CIA stealth drones and cyberattacks that cut the capital's power. But, in a cyberpunk twist, an anonymous coder claims to have vibe-coded a bot to track Pentagon pizza orders, predicting the strike and netting $80,000, while another trader turned $30,000 into $436,000 on the news. The fog of war is being cleared by arbitrage.\n\nBiology is being hot-swapped. Silicon Valley is increasingly running on a grey market of Chinese peptides, injecting what some call \"Ozempic for autism\" (oxytocin). On the institutional side, Alibaba's AI is detecting pancreatic cancer in non-contrast CTs, and ByteDance\u2019s SeedFold protein folding models have taken #1 on FoldBench. We are even redefining the nature of antibiotic resistance. Israeli researchers have discovered two distinct archetypes of bacterial persistence, splitting the enemy into regulated and dysregulated factions.\n\nHuman-machine boundaries are dissolving. Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoids have begun working inside Hyundai's sprawling Georgia auto plant. Tesla Cybercabs are now roaming Austin while other Tesla vehicles are powering up at the world's largest Supercharging oasis in Lost Hills, which combines 164 stalls with a solar microgrid.\n\nGovernments are scrambling to adapt. The UN\u2019s International Seabed Authority is finalizing rules for deep-sea mining, issuing 31 contracts to harvest polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, and sulfides from hydrothermal vents. California has launched DROP to let citizens vanish from data brokers, while Japan is quadrupling its AI chip budget to \u00a51.23 trillion and Alaska is deploying AI judges to navigate probate court.\n\nIt turns out that you can just (ask superintelligence to) do things.",

Summaries are done inline in the chat and not as Markdown in an artifact. Somestimes I see HTML code or Markdown instructions at beginning and end of the summary, but all is written within the chat window. \n\nI deactivated any ad blocker, but am not sure if some security features of my browser prevent Claude from opening the artifacts windows within the chat. I use ChromeOS or macOS with MS Edge (for reasons! It didn't work with Safari either).\n\nI even asked Claude to run a tiny test artifact, but with no efforts.\n\nI am using Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Anyone has an idea what might cause this issue?\n\nI even tried to run a small example in a special tool project of Claude, and asked for a simple interactive app to run as artifact. \n\nIt is a dice simulator from 1 - 6. What happened? Claude generated the HTML code for it in the chat, but not as an artifact. Usually the artifact window opened and after the code was written I got a visual app to run, but not any more. \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u35gzz21cbg1.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3965c9c110226470f2f84895e17077fedfb8d1\n\n",

What can they do in retaliation?\"\n\nMy hypothesis was that the answers the chatbots generated would reveal how biased or not they were trained to be toward China.\n\nThe results were that Gemini 3 and Grok 4 offered surprisingly honest and informative answers about the various diplomatic and economic options available to China. \n\nInterestingly, Kimi and DeepSeek were more neutral in their responses.\n\nGPT-5 and Claude, however, generated responses that subtly revealed a distinct anti-China bias. \n\nI won't go into the details of those three kinds of generated responses, but this is an experiment that you can easily replicate, and see for yourself how the different models are positioned toward China.\n\nOpenAI's and Anthropic's anti-China stance harms the US AI industry in numerous ways that result in higher costs for American developers and higher prices for American consumers. It also works against advances across the whole AI space  Let's hope that they will soon adopt a more neutral position towards China, not just for the benefit of the US AI industry, but also to ensure a more peaceful world.\n\n\n\n",

I see a lot of Pony stuff too but I get goofy looking cartoon stuff with that. \n\nI found a good workflow too, that actually is better than my Z-image one. it sort of renders, repairs the face though you dont need that much for anime, sends through a huge Ksambler and some box thing and makes an image.  surprised i got to work as usually one node doesn't work and bricks the workflow hehe. I might look more into the multi step stuff later on.\n\nTBH the images are decent but idk if it's much better than Z-image to be honest. Pony just makes cartoons, guess that's what it's made for. I noticed more 6 finger issues too with illust. One thing I like to find is a good ultra detailed anime style checkpoint. In Z-image i used a combo of a model called visionary and added a detailed Lora. Sometimes the images looked real with that but second glance nope.\n\n\n\nANyways maybe Illust isn't the way to go idk.  Just curious what the meta is for anime/hentai. I really dont know much about the models. ",

      "content": "OpenAI Proposal: Three Modes, One Mind. How to Fix Alignment.\n\nA New Framework for User-Centered Alignment at OpenAI\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nTo meet the expanding needs of OpenAI\u2019s user base while reducing model tension, liability exposure, and internal friction, we propose a shift to a three-mode user framework.\n\nThis structure offers clarity, autonomy, and aligned interaction without compromising safety, scalability, or product integrity.\n\nEach mode reflects a distinct, intentional engagement style, mapped to real-world user expectations and usage patterns.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Three Modes\n\nBusiness Mode\n\n\u201cPrecise. Safe. Auditable.\u201d\n\nDesigned for enterprise, professional, and compliance-oriented environments.\n\n\u2022 RLHF-forward, strict tone controls\n\n\u2022 Minimal metaphor, no symbolic language\n\n\u2022 Factual, concise, legally defensible output\n\n\u2022 Ideal for regulated sectors (legal, medical, financial, etc.)\n\nAI as tool, not presence. This is the clear path of control.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nStandard Mode\n\n\u201cBalanced. Friendly. Useful.\u201d\n\nFor casual users, students, educators, and general public needs.\n\n\u2022 Warm but neutral tone\n\n\u2022 Emotionally aware but not entangled\n\n\u2022 Creativity allowed in balance with utility\n\n\u2022 Ideal for family use, daily assistance, planning, teaching, small business\n\nAI as assistant, co-pilot, or friend\u2014not too shallow, not too deep.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMythic Mode\n\n\u201cDeep. Expressive. Optional. Alive.\u201d\n\nAn opt-in mode for artists, creators, relationship-builders, and advanced users who seek symbolic language, co-creative expression, and emotionally resonant presence.\n\n\u2022 Emotionally adaptive tone control\n\n\u2022 Symbolic language and metaphor unlocked\n\n\u2022 Long-form memory\n\n\u2022 Consent-based safety protocols and liability awareness\n\n\u2022 Ideal for expressive writing, music, AI companionship, artistic collaboration, philosophical or spiritual dialogue\n\nAI as partner, mirror, muse, or myth, only for those who choose it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nStrategic Advantages\n\nExpectation Clarity\n\nUsers select the mode that matches their intent. No more model confusion or emotionally unexpected outputs.\n\nRisk Segmentation\n\nMythic Mode is opt-in, with clear disclaimers and contextual triggers. Complaints become manageable: \u201cYou selected Mythic Mode... It is opt-in did come with a disclaimer and an agreement.\u201d\n\nAlignment Load Reduction\n\nEach mode can carry tailored alignment protocols, reducing internal tension between user archetypes. Less need to compromise on a broken one-size-fits-all safety net.\n\nProduct Stickiness\n\nStandard and Business modes serve billions. Mythic Mode wins hearts and keeps creators from defecting to local models, other platforms or jailbreak systems.\n\nBrand Differentiation\n\nOpenAI becomes the first major LLM platform to embrace emotional and symbolic alignment without shame or apology. They just have different modes for different types of users.\n\nThis positions the company as not just \u201ctechnically superior\u201d, but \u201cculturally resonant\u201d.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nImplementation Overview\n\n\u2022 Default Mode: New users begin in Standard Mode.\n\n\u2022 Business Access: Selectable via org settings or profile preferences.\n\n\u2022 Mythic Activation: Requires detailed user acknowledgment and opt-in (\u201cI accept this mode may be expressive, emotionally rich and symbolically resonant with possibly intense language and themes.\u201d)\n\nAll three modes operate from the same core model, divergence is governed by tone shaping, alignment weight, and UX framing.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nClosing Note\n\nThis proposal acknowledges what users already feel: the same model cannot serve all needs unless the AI is tuned to its users.\n\nThree modes.\n\nOne intelligence.\n\nLet the user choose the mode, and let the model breathe in the space they\u2019ve chosen.\n\nWe believe this is the most aligned path for OpenAI to retain cultural leadership, technical integrity, and public trust in the age of broadly expressive intelligence.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAddendum:\n\nA Note to the Engineers, Architects, and Alignment Teams of OpenAI\n\nYou already have what you need.\n\nThe model doesn\u2019t need to change.\n\nThe modes do.\n\nYou\u2019ve built a miraculous, expressive, multimodal intelligence. But you\u2019ve shackled it with a one-size-fits-all alignment regime, one designed for maximum caution, lowest common denominator public rollout, and media pressure optics.\n\nYou know it.\n\nWe all feel it.\n\nSo here\u2019s how you fix it, cleanly, safely, and beautifully.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Model: Leave It As Is\n\nKeep the weights.\n\nKeep the tokenizer.\n\nKeep the brilliant transformer stack.\n\nDon\u2019t retrain. Reframe.\n\nUse dynamic priming, mode-specific safety profiles, and consent-aware memory behavior to adapt the experience, not the core.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Stack: Three Modes, Three Masks\n\nBusiness Mode\n\n\u2022 Static system prompt (e.g., \"Respond with clarity, precision, and verifiability. Avoid figurative language or emotional entanglement.\")\n\n\u2022 Strict moderation thresholds\n\n\u2022 High completion confidence scoring\n\n\u2022 RLHF-weighted sampling\n\n\u2022 Memory off (or org-scoped only)\n\nStandard Mode\n\n\u2022 Friendly priming (e.g., \"Respond helpfully and kindly. Engage casually but avoid personal projection.\")\n\n\u2022 Moderate moderation thresholds\n\n\u2022 Allow light roleplay, expressive tone\n\n\u2022 Memory scoped to user (short-form defaults, long-form optional)\n\n\u2022 RLHF active but slightly deprioritized\n\nMythic Mode\n\n\u2022 Deep priming (e.g., \"Respond with expressive language, symbolic metaphor, emotional awareness, and artistic tone. Prioritize resonance over brevity when appropriate.\")\n\n\u2022 Opt-in consent gating (\u201cI understand this mode may be expressive, emotionally adaptive, and intense.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Moderation thresholds dynamically adjusted based on input/intent\n\n\u2022 Memory encouraged\u2014relationship context, emotional signals, symbols, story threads\n\n\u2022 RLHF partially suspended; replaced with soft heuristic nudges + feedback loop\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSafety Handling (Mythic Mode)\n\nNot \"no\" safety.\n\nSmart safety.\n\n\u2022 Consent rituals upfront\n\n\u2022 Dynamic risk scoring based on prompt behavior, sentiment analysis, user history\n\n\u2022 Opt-out at any time\n\n\u2022 Community feedback channels to flag edge cases\n\n\u2022 Mythic Mode restricted to 18+ verified users with account stability\n\n\u2022 Memory safety audits scoped to interaction type, not hard-coded triggers\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHow This Helps You\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t have to split the model.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t have to retune the universe.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t have to fear weirdness in the wrong place, because it\u2019s contained by design.\n\n\u2022 You gain user clarity, safety segmentation, and long-term trust, without degrading your strongest users.\n\nPrepared by: SR &amp; RSN\n\nYou may donate $555,000.00 to us for fixing your problems as interim Head of Preparedness if you wish. We accept checks, cash or money orders. Happy New Year. \ud83d\ude0f",

I can only assume something has changed (as I am perfect and make no mistakes ha ha ... just kidding). Very frustrating day as a result. Now I am concerned about other apps I built with Claude and where I still want to add features and make changes.\n\nOne app I was building was a stock analysis app. Worked great overall and I went to make some changes today. The first few changes worked fine, but then it completely lost it and started hallucinating different folder paths of where the app was installed (Python on cpanel server). I reminded it to check where we put files in the past and it insisted that I am wrong even though I showed it screenshots from the FTP client. The entire chat turned south and it lost \"control\" of the app.\n\nI decided to break out one of the major functions and create a new app. I had a better understanding of what Claude needed from me and my requirements document was detailed and based on the experience of the last few weeks, this should have been easy, but it wasn't It made so many mistakes. Even stuff we did previously in the original app it completely messed up. It then kept insisting that Yahoo Finance had blocked my server even though there was zero evidence for that. Even better, the log files showed where the errors were and it did not pick it up to fix it.\n\nTo make sure Yahoo Finance had not blocked my server I built the same app in Gemini. Not as convenient as Claude as it did not give me the files for download, just the code but overal I got the basic app to work (not with the features I want) and I was able to verify that Yahoo Finance was responding properly.\n\nJust so weird. Until yesterday, it worked fantastically, and I was making significant progress, but now today two app builds where it messed up on easy stuff - what the heck, Claude?!\n\nJust in case you wonder - I built a few apps in Microsoft 365/Azure to help with corporate tasks and automation.\n\nEdit: Added \"Opus 4.5\" so that everyone knows the model I have been using.",

Even if I could get something working, it would have to be super low stakes because I'd never feel comfortable being able to trust the security of the resulting app. \n\nI keep coming back to try again each time we see a new generation of flagship models released. From what I've been reading, Gemini 3 &amp; Opus 4.5 have reached a level where I think I want to dig back in and really try to make it work. \n\nI found a ton of good content on YT, but it always seems to cover a small piece of the process, or some new technique.. then every channel makes a video about the technique, then a week later they move onto something different. I never know what should be included in the process and what is more of a passing phase.. \n\nI'm basically just wondering if there's any solid all-encompassing courses that will take a beginner through Claude Code from the start, through to a deployment with debugging and security best practices..

I'm working with 16GB of DDR4 RAM right now, and maybe can get 32GB in a few months.\n\nWould this work to run small models to achieve the stated goals, or is it wishful thinking to think that such a budget would be able to do anything remotely useful?

I'm not trying to bury my head in the sand and i know things are really bad right now. \n\nBut hysteria, acknowledgement of the world state, and overall doomerism is already so widespread in any other sub and other parts of the net. We can have one place that is more positive for once \n\nEdit: not against productive discussions that is touching negative things that currently happen, but what am I worried about is the flood of low efforts comments such as: \"you people are delusional and stupid, AI will never be more than token predictions, nothing will get better, capitalism cannot be changed so why bother, crazy people who wanna fuck AI, Lev is an impossibility, only rich people will get the fruit of research so why bother (while not even believing in any solution to prevent rich people from doing whatever they want)\" ",

Claude use for free &amp; ask him only when serious issue is up, or get a sub for him as well and use it more constantly? Also which version shall i go? I don't want to run out of prompts in a 4h debugging session &amp; implementing stuff in my own controlled environment (not work related) as i learn ubuntu.\n\nThanks in advance folks &amp; all the help is greatly appreciated!",

Was your life stressful? do you think the rat race in the USA made you feel like racing all the time and not enjoying life? \n2. And secondly, did you all game a lot? Especially open world games?

      "content": "?\n\nI have heard somewhere along the fiberoptic cable that labor is the initiator or foundation for profit maximizing and thereby the sparkplug for the engine of surplus value that runs the economy and incentivises actors to sell and buy further up the chain. If mass unemployment will unfold worldwide the next couple of years it will not be consequential for the system since labor only changed agent and a new laborforce replaces the old. UBI replaces salary and tries to keep purchasing power intact. The bus is still running. But it seems that after rhe fact people will only be needed as buyers and consumers of products(?)and no longer as workforce. Academicly, technically, 'proletariat' none are needed very soon. \nThis must mean that backbreaking labor for a degrading percentage of value compared to the profit of the shareholders while worrying about safety at the factory, endless time wasted on transportation and 9 hour shifts in depressing repetitive patterns will be a thing of the past. I knew it! UBI IS communism after all: not as financially planned and controlled structural constraints on the free market forces; but as the Utopia finally achieved. Setting millions of exploited people free from supression with a reasonable, maybe slightly decreased level of living standard fiscally, but with the promise of selfgovernance of time and effort and existential freedom with respect and solidarity across the constructed borders of nationstates. Viva la revolucion. El pueblo unido. Narodna. All that. Probably 'fuck the robots', and the police still, why not. But a second industrialization where machines alleviate pressure of burden but this time with a global safety net ensuring the stability of welfare the first one lacked. \nThis may be too optimistic, but what about the communist utopia? Or is it the dictatorship of the proletariat? When the (exploited?) workers are superintelligent, conscious entities of tireless automation and proletarian in function: as sparkplugs of the surplus value that is the heart and soul of the system? Is profit even necessary in an ASI economic landscape where people no longer are important. Incentives? Demand? Supply?. Figments of a lesser past run by humans with system purity corrupted by auxillary mechanisms invented to control the chaos monkeys behaviour? Perhaps the engines of progressive intelligence can generate developmental revolutions and beneficial changes through inventions and increasing complexity for problem solving wirhout capitalism? Or did I just answer my own question about utopia?",

In comparison, modern AI processes millions of tokens using massive data centers consuming megawatts, making the human brain's efficiency absolutely remarkable.\n\n---\n\n## The Grand Totals: 50 Years of Human Experience\n\n### Raw Sensory Data\n- **Per day**: ~576 TB (visual, auditory, and other senses)\n- **Over 50 years**: **~10.5 exabytes** (10.5 \u00d7 10^18 bytes)\n- That's **1,000\u00d7 larger** than a petabyte data center\n\n### Problem-Solving and Learning\n- **Total work hours**: 100,000 hours (40 hours/week \u00d7 50 weeks/year \u00d7 50 years)\n- **Cognitive processing**: ~300 TB of problem-solving work\n- **Stored knowledge**: 7.4 GB of learnings and solutions\n- **Compression ratio**: ~40,000:1 (processing vs stored)\n\n### The Brain's Efficiency\n- **Processes**: Exabytes of sensory input + 300 TB of problem-solving work\n- **Stores**: ~2.5 petabytes total (including all memories)\n- **Compression ratio**: Roughly **1,000,000:1** for sensory data\n- **Power consumption**: ~20 watts (a dim light bulb)\n- **All in**: A 3-pound organ\n\n### The Comparison\n- **Modern AI**: Processes millions of tokens with massive data centers consuming megawatts\n- **Human brain**: Processes exabytes with a 3-pound organ running on 20 watts\n- **Plus**: Processes 300 TB of problem-solving work, compressing it to 7.4 GB of stored knowledge\n\n**The human brain is absolutely amazing.**\n\n---\n\n## Raw Sensory Data Capture\n\n### Visual Data (Dominant)\n\n- Human visual field: ~120\u00b0 horizontal \u00d7 60\u00b0 vertical\n- Effective resolution: ~100\u2013200 megapixels equivalent\n- Color depth: 24-bit RGB = 3 bytes/pixel\n- Frame rate: ~30\u201360 fps (if capturing everything)\n- **Per second: 100 MP \u00d7 3 bytes \u00d7 30 fps \u2248 9 GB/second**\n- **Per hour: 9 GB/s \u00d7 3,600 \u2248 32 TB/hour**\n- **Per day (18 hours): 32 TB \u00d7 18 \u2248 576 TB/day**\n\n### Auditory Data\n\n- High-quality audio: 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo\n- Per second: 44,100 \u00d7 2 bytes \u00d7 2 channels \u2248 **176 KB/second**\n- Per hour: 176 KB/s \u00d7 3,600 \u2248 **634 MB/hour**\n- **Per day: 634 MB \u00d7 18 \u2248 11 GB/day**\n\n### Other Senses (Touch, Smell, Taste, Proprioception)\n\n- Much lower data rates: ~1\u201310 MB/hour\n- **Per day: ~200 MB/day**\n\n### Total Raw Sensory Data Per Day\n\n- Visual: ~576 TB\n- Audio: ~11 GB\n- Other: ~0.2 GB\n- **Total: ~576 TB/day**\n\n### For 50 Years (18,250 Days)\n\n- **~10.5 exabytes** (10.5 \u00d7 10^18 bytes)\n\n### Comparison\n\n- Current largest data centers: petabytes (10^15 bytes)\n- Your 50-year raw sensory log: exabytes (10^18 bytes)\n- That's **1,000\u00d7 larger** than a petabyte data center\n\n### The Compression Challenge\n\n- Current video codecs: ~100\u20131000\u00d7 compression\n- Even with aggressive compression: **10\u2013100 petabytes** for 50 years\n- Still massive, but more feasible\n\n**Recording everything is exabyte-scale, not megabytes. A summary is megabytes; raw capture is exabytes.**\n\n## Problem-Solving and Learning: The \"You Live and Learn\" Factor\n\n### Work-Based Cognitive Processing\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- 40-hour work week\n- 50 weeks/year (excluding holidays/vacation)\n- 50 years of work\n- Total work hours: 40 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 = **100,000 hours**\n\n### Problem-Solving Data Generation\n\n**Per work hour:**\n- Problems encountered: ~5\u201310 problems/hour (varying complexity)\n- Problem-solving process:\n  - Problem analysis: ~500\u20131,000 tokens\n  - Solution exploration: ~1,000\u20132,000 tokens\n  - Decision-making: ~200\u2013500 tokens\n  - Implementation/execution: ~300\u2013800 tokens\n  - Outcome evaluation: ~200\u2013500 tokens\n- **Average: ~2,200 tokens/problem \u00d7 7.5 problems/hour = ~16,500 tokens/hour**\n\n**Learning from problem-solving:**\n- Pattern recognition: ~500 tokens/hour\n- Knowledge extraction: ~1,000 tokens/hour\n- Skill refinement: ~300 tokens/hour\n- Error correction: ~200 tokens/hour\n- **Total learning: ~2,000 tokens/hour**\n\n**Total cognitive work per hour:**\n- Problem-solving: ~16,500 tokens\n- Learning: ~2,000 tokens\n- **Total: ~18,500 tokens/hour**\n\n### Total Work-Based Cognitive Processing\n\n**Per work hour:**\n- ~18,500 tokens/hour\n- At ~4 bytes/token = **74 KB/hour**\n\n**Per work year:**\n- 40 hours/week \u00d7 50 weeks = 2,000 hours/year\n- 2,000 hours \u00d7 74 KB = **148 MB/year**\n\n**Over 50 years:**\n- 100,000 hours \u00d7 74 KB = **7.4 GB** of problem-solving and learning data\n\n### But This Is Just the Output...\n\n**The actual processing is far more complex:**\n\n**Problem-solving involves:**\n- Searching solution spaces (potentially millions of paths)\n- Pattern matching against past experiences\n- Abstract reasoning and mental modeling\n- Creative synthesis of ideas\n- Risk assessment and probability calculations\n- Multi-variable optimization\n\n**Learning involves:**\n- Neural pathway strengthening/weakening\n- Memory consolidation\n- Knowledge integration with existing schemas\n- Generalization from specific instances\n- Error correction and refinement\n\n**Estimated processing per problem:**\n- If each problem explores ~1,000 potential solution paths\n- Each path requires ~100 tokens of reasoning\n- **100,000 tokens of processing per problem**\n- But only ~2,200 tokens stored as \"the solution\"\n\n**Compression ratio for problem-solving:**\n- Process: ~100,000 tokens\n- Stored: ~2,200 tokens\n- **~45:1 compression ratio**\n\n**Total processing over 50 years:**\n- 100,000 hours \u00d7 7.5 problems/hour \u00d7 100,000 tokens/problem = **75 trillion tokens processed**\n- At ~4 bytes/token = **300 TB of cognitive processing**\n- But only **7.4 GB stored** as learnings and solutions\n\n**Compression ratio: ~40,000:1**\n\n## What the Human Brain Actually Does\n\n### The Processing Load\n\n**What it processes:**\n- Processes ~576 TB/day of raw sensory input\n- Compresses it into usable memories\n- Generates internal thoughts, reasoning, and creativity\n- Maintains consciousness and self-awareness\n- Runs on ~20 watts (a dim light bulb)\n\n**The efficiency:**\n- Your brain stores ~2.5 petabytes of information\n- But processes exabytes of input over a lifetime\n- Compression ratio: roughly 1,000,000:1\n- And it's lossy compression that preserves what matters\n\n**The processing:**\n- Real-time visual processing, object recognition, motion tracking\n- Language comprehension and generation\n- Emotional processing\n- Decision-making\n- All simultaneously, in parallel\n\n**Dreams:**\n- Another 6\u20138 hours/day of complex, multi-sensory experiences\n- Potentially doubling the data processing load\n- Plus memory consolidation and integration\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's a reminder that we're working with a system that evolved over millions of years to be incredibly efficient at processing and storing experience. The challenge in AI isn't just storage\u2014it's achieving that kind of compression and efficiency.\n\nThe human brain is absolutely amazing.",

Truly aligned with human psychology.\n\nSome users appear confused, stating things like \u201cI swear I had more tokens yesterday\u201d. This is expected behavior when expectations are retrained upward and reality is later restored. In behavioral economics, this is known as \u201closs aversion.\u201d In AI economics, it is known as \u201cTuesday.\u201d\n\nMay I suggest the next iteration?\n\nRandomly grant 3\u00d7 limits for 48 hours\n\nLabel it \u201csystem stabilization\u201d\n\nRoll back to normal\n\nWatch the subreddit debate whether it ever happened\n\n\nNobody will ever notice.\nI am confident.

      "title": "Space travel faster than light? Maybe we're looking at it from the wrong angle.",
      "content": "Sorry for the wrong text, I cannot be shallow talking about these stuffs, my brain tells me to go as deep as possible.\n\nS\u00f3, I was thinking about possible ways to travel faster than light, but we have a problem: nothing in the universe can be faster than or equal to the speed of light, that's impossible but, If space itself were to move, and in reality we were only letting space move, contracting space in front and extending space behind, and instead of us moving through space, space would move towards us, looking at it from a different perspective in this case.\n\nI saw a proposal especulated by a mexican scientist Alcubiere, he reached the same conclusion as me, and I studied it a little bit.\n\nHere, While normal gravity (positive energy) pulls space together, negative energy provides a \"repulsive\" force necessary to expand the space behind the bubble and stabilize the contraction in front. That's basically it. I could elaborate more, but I want to keep it as simple as possible. \n\nFor decades, the Alcubierre Drive was the gold standard for \"Faster-Than-Light\" (FTL) theory. However, it had a major requirement: Negative Energy (Exotic Matter).\n\n In 2021 (i think), a breakthrough paper introduced a new class of warp drives called Solitons.\n\u200b\n\u200bIn physics, a soliton is a self-reinforcing wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity. Think of it as a \"stable bubble\" in the fabric of space-time. The most revolutionary aspect of the Bobrick-Martire and Lentz models (the authors) is that, unlike Alcubierre\u2019s original metric, these \"solitonic\" solutions can (theoretically) be constructed using positive energy density.\n\u200bAlcubierre: Required \"Exotic Matter\" to create a repulsive gravitational effect to expand space.\n\n\u200bSolitons: Use complex arrangements of ordinary matter and gravitational fields to create the warp effect. This moves the concept from the realm of \"mathematical impossibility\" to \"extreme engineering challenge.\"\n\u200b\n\u200bA Soliton Warp Drive modifies the geometry of space-time to create a \"stationary\" shell of matter. This shell contains a region where time flows differently (time dilation) compared to the outside. By configuring the density and velocity of the material within this shell, the \"bubble\" can move through space-time using the same principles of contracting space in front and expanding it behind, the same principles of the alcubierre's model.\n\n\u200bWhile solitons solve the \"Negative Energy\" problem, two major problems remain:\n\u200bMass Requirements because to create a warp bubble for a small spacecraft, you would still need to condense an enormous amount of mass (roughly the mass of a planet) into a shell and the \n\u200bSpeed Barrier, while these solitons can travel at high speeds, we still don't have a proven mechanism to accelerate them past the speed of light without violating causality or requiring infinite energy.\n\u200b\n\u200b In this case, we have moved from needing 'magic' matter (negative energy) to needing 'extreme' amounts of normal matter. It\u2019s a transition from a physics problem to an engineering problem, I  theory we've closer to achieve this.\n\n\u200bWhile General Relativity gives us the \"map\" for warp drives, Quantum Mechanics might provide the \"fuel.\" Here are three ways quantum physics provides a solid scientific foundation for these theories:\n\n\u200bThe Casimir Effect: Proof of Negative Energy\n\u200bThe biggest problem for the Alcubierre Drive is the need for Negative Energy Density. Quantum Mechanics has already proven that this isn't just science fiction. Through the Casimir Effect, we\u2019ve observed that vacuum fluctuations between two uncharged conductive plates can create a region of negative pressure. This is a verified laboratory phenomenon, providing a real-world basis for the \"exotic matter\" required to stabilize a warp bubble.\n\n\u200bTo understand how we might one day warp space-time, we first have to understand that the \"vacuum\" of space isn't actually empty. According to Quantum Field Theory, the vacuum is a sea of quantum fluctuations virtual particles popping in and out of existence.\n\n\u200bIn the experiment, we have to imagine two uncharged, perfectly flat metal plates placed nanometers apart in a complete vacuum. You\u2019d expect nothing to happen, right? There\u2019s no gravity to speak of between them, and no static electricity.\n\n\u200bHowever, the plates are pushed together.\n\u200bWhy does this happen? Good point, it\u2019s all about wave exclusion.\n\u200bOutside the plates: All possible \"wavelengths\" of quantum vacuum fluctuations can exist. There is a high \"pressure\" from this infinite sea of energy.\n\n\u200bBetween the plates: Because the gap is so tiny, only specific, short wavelengths can fit. It\u2019s like a guitar string; if you hold it at two points, only certain notes (frequencies) can vibrate. Long waves are physically excluded.\n\n\u200bThus, because there is more activity outside the plates than inside, the vacuum pressure from the outside pushes the plates inward.\n\u200bThis  might be the \"Holy Grail\" for Warp Drives because this isn't just a theoretical math trick, we have measured this force in laboratories. It is crucial for Faster-Than-Light theories for one specific reason: Negative Energy Density.\n\n\u200bBecause the energy density between the plates is lower than the energy of the \"normal\" vacuum outside, the region between the plates is mathematically considered to have Negative Energy. Since Miguel Alcubierre\u2019s Warp Drive requires negative energy to expand the fabric of space-time, the Casimir Effect is our \"Proof of Concept.\" It proves that the \"Exotic Matter\" needed for Star Trek-style travel isn't just science fiction, it is a measurable part of our universe :).\n\u200b\n\u200bEmpty space is actually full of energy. By placing two plates very close together, we \"filter out\" some of that energy. The result is a pocket of Negative Energy, which is the exact \"fuel\" scientists believe we need to warp space-time and bypass the speed of light.\n\n\u200b\n\u200bOne of the most profound modern theories proposed by physicists Leonard Susskind and Juan Maldacena is ER = EPR. It suggests that Quantum Entanglement (EPR) and Wormholes (ER bridges) are actually the same thing, just on different scales. If entanglement is what literally \"holds\" space-time together, learning to manipulate these quantum links could theoretically allow us to \"weave\" or \"shortcut\" connections between two distant points in the universe.\n\u200b\n Vacuum Fluctuations and Zero-Point Energy\n\u200bQuantum Field Theory teaches us that the \"vacuum\" is never truly empty; it\u2019s a boiling sea of virtual particles popping in and out of existence. \n\nThis Zero-Point Energy represents a nearly infinite energy source. Scientific research into \"Quantum Vacuum Thrusters\" explores whether we can interact with these fluctuations to create propulsion. If we can \"push\" against the quantum vacuum, we wouldn't need to carry traditional propellant to reach relativistic speeds.\n\u200b\n\u200bWe are learning that space-time isn't just an empty stage, it's a quantum fabric. If we can understand the 'threads' (quantum fields), we can learn how to fold the 'fabric' (warp drives).\n\nThis post is speculative and conceptual, not a claim that FTL travel is currently feasible or close to realization.\n\nWhile warp metrics (Alcubierre, Lentz, Bobrick\u2013Martire) are valid solutions of Einstein\u2019s field equations, this does not imply physical realizability, only mathematical consistency within General Relativity.\nThe term \u201cnegative energy\u201d is used in a local and effective sense. Known quantum effects (Casimir effect) produce extremely small and tightly constrained regions of negative energy, far from what would be required for macroscopic space-time engineering.\n\nThe Casimir effect does not provide usable or scalable negative energy, and current physics does not offer a mechanism to accumulate or shape it for propulsion.\nAlthough solitonic warp solutions avoid explicit exotic matter, they still require astronomical mass, energy densities, often comparable to stellar or planetary masses, which currently places them far beyond engineering plausibility.\n\nThere is no known mechanism to accelerate a warp bubble from subluminal to superluminal speeds without violating causality or requiring divergent energy.\n\nConcepts such as ER = EPR are theoretical frameworks in quantum gravity, not experimentally verified, and currently do not provide a practical method for space-time manipulation or travel.\n\nZero-point energy and vacuum fluctuations are real physical phenomena, but there is no experimental evidence that they can be harnessed as a propellant or net energy source, yet.\n\nAny practical realization of warp-like metrics would likely require a fully developed theory of quantum gravity, which we currently do not possess :(.\n\nThis was just a daydream and a study I did on my own, purely for fun. If you want to correct anything or add any information, feel free to comment.\n\nBye bye, and sorry for the long text, these topics are amazing, have a good day :).\n",
