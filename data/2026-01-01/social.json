A lot of hours were spent in marathon clip review sessions late into the night looking over interventions as we attempted legs of the drive over time - triaging, categorizing, planning out all the projects to close the gap and bring the number of interventions to zero.\n\nAmazing to see the system actually get there and huge congrats to the team!",

      "content": "Looking back on AI progress in 2025: people are increasingly weighing how AI should fit into our lives and how vital it is for the United States to lead in its development. Being pro-AI does not mean being anti-regulation. It means being thoughtful — crafting policies that secure AI’s transformative benefits while mitigating risks and preserving flexibility as the technology continues to evolve rapidly.\n\nThis year, my wife Anna and I started getting involved politically, including through political contributions, reflecting support for policies that advance American innovation and constructive dialogue between government and the technology sector. These views are grounded in a belief that the United States must work closely with builders, researchers, and entrepreneurs to ensure AI is developed responsibly at home and that we remain globally competitive.\n\nAI has the potential to democratize entrepreneurship and the American dream, make healthcare more affordable and effective, provide access to high-quality education, accelerate scientific discovery, expand economic opportunity, and strengthen national competitiveness and security. We feel this potential personally; through Anna’s experience navigating the healthcare system with complex chronic conditions that don’t fit neatly into any specialty, we’ve seen firsthand how AI can empower people and lead to better health outcomes. AI represents an opportunity to truly improve healthcare, one we shouldn’t squander.\n\nWe’ve been encouraged by the growing seriousness with which policymakers in Washington are approaching US leadership in AI, which we’ve long believed depends on optimism, curiosity to explore, and serious infrastructure development. As I expressed at a recent White House technology leaders’ dinner, it’s been great to see the president’s and his administration’s willingness to engage directly with the AI community and approach emerging technology with a growth-focused mindset and goal of helping to ensure continued US leadership in AI and supporting American economic competitiveness.\n\nWe believe that AI can be a force to improve quality of life for every human (and for every animal).

      "content": "Ivy League to Carnegie Mellon - AI Degree Boom is Exploding—and Campuses Are Running Out of Space - @CarnegieMellon @PennEngineers \n\nAt the center of this surge is Chris Callison-Burch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League, institution. When he first taught his A.I. course in 2018, enrollment hovered around 100. Seven years later, the class has exploded to ~500 in-person, ~250 remote learners, and another 100–200 on the waitlist. The course now occupies Penn’s largest lecture hall, with Callison-Burch noting that further growth would require moving classes into the university’s sports stadium.\n\nThis demand runs far beyond the Ivy League. Across the country, both elite and public institutions are experiencing similar surges:\n\nCarnegie Mellon University, long regarded as a global leader in artificial intelligence, continues to see overwhelming demand for its AI programs, reinforcing its status as a bellwether in the field.\nThe University at Buffalo expanded its AI master’s enrollment from just five students in 2020 to 100 in the previous year.\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, undergraduate AI enrollment surged from 37 students in 2022 to more than 300.\nMiami Dade College reported a 75% increase in AI enrollment since 2022, while other programs remained largely flat—except for a slight decline in traditional computer science.\n\nCallison-Burch says the decline in traditional computer science education is becoming a national pattern, while demand for AI education is exploding. Many educators believe that AI-driven education is reshaping entry-level computing roles, prompting students to pivot toward specialized AI training. Some numbers maybe slightly rounded off for the sake of article. \n\nExperts offer a range of guidance for students navigating this shift:\n\nDemis Hassabis urges students to immerse themselves deeply in AI.\nGeoffrey Hinton advocates pairing mathematics and science with AI.\nYann LeCun emphasizes the importance of learning how to learn, recommending foundational fields like math, physics, and engineering for their long-term value.\n\nReferences \n\nTremayne-Pengelly, A.

I love you all! ❤️\n\nSecond, here's my conversation with Joel David Hamkins (@JDHamkins), mathematician and philosopher specializing in set theory, the foundations of mathematics, and the nature of infinity. We talk about paradoxes that challenged some of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, Gödel Incompleteness theorems, the mathematical multiverse, the nature of truth, computation, and much more.\n\nBy the way, Joel is the #1 highest-rated user on MathOverflow, and writes a great blog called \"Infinitely More\".\n\nIt's here on X in full and is up everywhere else (see comment).\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:17 - Infinity & paradoxes\n49:27 - Russell's paradox\n1:02:35 - Gödel's incompleteness theorems\n1:20:06 - Truth vs proof\n1:31:30 - The Halting Problem\n1:47:23 - Does infinity exist?\n2:04:57 - MathOverflow\n2:08:49 - The Continuum Hypothesis\n2:18:36 - Hardest problems in mathematics\n2:28:03 - Mathematical multiverse\n2:46:55 - Surreal numbers\n2:57:33 - Conway's Game of Life\n2:59:49 - Computability theory\n3:09:41 - P vs NP\n3:12:58 - Greatest mathematicians in history\n3:26:43 - Infinite chess\n3:45:01 - Most beautiful idea in mathematics",

      "content": "Meet La Brea Tar Pits Museum Giant Lion at LA! \n\nScientists Found the Remarkably Preserved Corpse of a 35,000-Year-Old Giant in Siberia Ice Age\n\nThe Giant lion at the La Brea Tar Pits Museum is a striking reconstruction of Smilodon fatalis, an extinct saber toothed cat whose lion-like build, powerful forelimb, and forward-facing gaze make the comparison to modern lions almost instinctive from earlier age. Smilodon filled a similar apex-predator role in Ice Age Los Angeles City, ambushing large herbivores such as ground sloths and bison near asphalt seeps that ultimately trapped predator and prey alike. Genomic research on a related but distinct saber-toothed lineagethe scimitar toothed cat Homotherium latidens reveals how deeply divergent these Ice Age cats were from modern felines, evolving unique adaptations for vision, metabolism, and hunting strategies over millions of years. Together, fossil evidence from La Brea and genomic insights from Homotherium underscore that this 'giant lion' represents not a modern cat ancestor, but a powerful, specialized predator from a lost evolutionary world. \n\nReferences \n\nBarnett, R., Westbury, M.

      "content": "@NightSkyNow I propose that the comet core is tumbling (“rotating”), presenting different sides (almost certainly chaotically) towards the Sun all along its journey through the Solar System. It is highly unlikely that either it formed with zero net spin (angular momentum L) or it currently has zero L after all of the outgassing and comet jet ejections. Newton’s 3rd law (of Action-Reaction) governs a lot of the “odd” behaviors observed in comets. They are not point masses, but asymmetric conglomerates of ice, snow, rocks, gravel, boulders, pebbles, etc. with different compositions, volatility, cohesion, chemical reactivity to sunlight, and so forth. They are marvelous diverse objects birthed and shaped through billions of years of travel across a maelstrom of Milky Way environments. We are witnessing in real time the unraveling of some of that history.",
