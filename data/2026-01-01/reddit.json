      "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard this from your favorite AI YouTubers. You\u2019ve definitely read it on this sub about a million times: \u201cWhere are the GGUFs?!\u201d, \u201cJust download magical GGUFs if you have low VRAM\u201d, \u201cThe model must fit your VRAM\u201d, \u201cQuality loss is marginal\u201d and other sacred mantras. I certainly have. What I somehow missed were actual comparison results. These claims are always presented as unquestionable common knowledge. Any skepticism? Instant downvotes from the faithful.\n\nSo I decided to commit the ultimate Reddit sin and test it myself, using the hot new **Qwen Image 2512**. The model is a modest 41 GB in size. Unfortunately I am a poor peasant with only 16 GB of VRAM. But fear not. Surely GGUFs will save the day.\n\nMy system has a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 16 GB of VRAM, driver 580.95.05, CUDA 13.0. System memory is 96 GB DDR5. I am running the latest ComfyUI with sage attention. Default Qwen Image workflow 1328x1328 image resolution, 20 steps and CFG 2.5.\n\nOriginal [41 Gb bf16](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/blob/main/split_files/diffusion_models/qwen_image_2512_bf16.safetensors) model.\n\n    got prompt\n    Requested to load QwenImageTEModel_\n    Unloaded partially: 3133.02 MB freed, 4429.44 MB remains loaded, 324.11 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 9901.39 MB usable, 8946.75 MB loaded, full load: True\n    loaded partially; 14400.05 MB usable, 14175.94 MB loaded, 24791.96 MB offloaded, 216.07 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    100% 20/20 [01:04&lt;00:00,  3.21s/it]\n    Requested to load WanVAE\n    Unloaded partially: 6613.48 MB freed, 7562.46 MB remains loaded, 324.11 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 435.31 MB usable, 242.03 MB loaded, full load: True\n    Prompt executed in 71.13 seconds\n\nPrompt executed in 71.13 seconds, 3.21s/it.\n\nNow [qwen-image-2512-Q5\\_K\\_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen-Image-2512-GGUF/blob/main/qwen-image-2512-Q5_K_M.gguf) a magical 15 Gb GGUF, carefully selected to fit entirely in VRAM just like Reddit told me to do.\n\n    got prompt\n    Requested to load QwenImageTEModel_\n    Unloaded partially: 3167.86 MB freed, 4628.85 MB remains loaded, 95.18 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 9876.02 MB usable, 8946.75 MB loaded, full load: True\n    loaded completely; 14574.08 MB usable, 14412.98 MB loaded, full load: True\n    100% 20/20 [01:27&lt;00:00,  4.36s/it]\n    Requested to load WanVAE\n    Unloaded partially: 6616.31 MB freed, 7796.71 MB remains loaded, 88.63 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 369.09 MB usable, 242.03 MB loaded, full load: True\n    Prompt executed in 92.26 seconds\n\n92.26 seconds total. 4.36 s/it. About 30% slower than the full 41 Gb model. And yes, the quality is worse too. Shockingly compressing the model did not make it better or faster.\n\nSo there you go. A GGUF that fits perfectly in VRAM, runs slower and produces worse results. Exactly as advertised.\n\nStill believing Reddit wisdom? Do your own research, people. Memory offloading is fine. If you have system memory to fit original model go for it, same with fp8.\n\n# Little update for people who were nice to actually comment on topic\n\nGGUF Q2\\_K, size \\~7 Gb\n\n    got prompt\n    Unloaded partially: 2127.43 MB freed, 4791.96 MB remains loaded, 35.47 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 9884.93 MB usable, 8946.75 MB loaded, full load: True\n    Unloaded partially: 3091.46 MB freed, 5855.28 MB remains loaded, 481.58 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 8648.80 MB usable, 6919.35 MB loaded, full load: True\n    100% 20/20 [01:17&lt;00:00,  3.86s/it]\n    Requested to load WanVAE\n    Unloaded partially: 5855.28 MB freed, 0.00 MB remains loaded, 3256.09 MB buffer reserved, lowvram patches: 0\n    loaded completely; 1176.41 MB usable, 242.03 MB loaded, full load: True\n    Prompt executed in 81.21 seconds\n\n81.21 seconds total. 3.86 s/it.

Why Facebook gave me the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, and also *serves* the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, I have absolutely no idea!\n\nAnyways, if you want to try the model, I would recommend trying both the [128k version](https://huggingface.co/shb777/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct), as well as my [original version](https://huggingface.co/allura-forge/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct) if your task supports 8k context lengths. I honestly have absolutely no clue which is more correct, but oh well! I do wish Facebook had released the weights officially, because back in April, this really wouldn't have been that bad of a model...\n\nEdit: Removed the Tau-Bench results (both from here and the readme). The traces from the evals are, to put it slightly, really fucky-wucky, and I don't think OpenBench is scoring them right, but I'm too tired to actually debug the issue, so. I'll figure it out tomorrow :3",

      "content": "Update:  Thanks for the strong response and questions!  Based on some of your feedback, I've just released 0.5.x, which adds a bunch of new features and provides the ability to do metrics so you can tell how much context you're really saving.  Check out the follow up post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q1hssl/pommel_v050_hybrid_search_benchmarks_and/)!\n\n\n\nI kept hitting the same problem: I'd ask Claude Code to help with something, and it would read 30+ files trying to understand where the relevant code was. By the time it found what it needed, half my context window was gone.\n\nSo I built **Pommel** \\- a local semantic code search tool. Instead of Claude Code grepping through your codebase or reading entire directories, you can search for \"authentication flow\" or \"rate limiting logic\" and get back the specific functions/classes that actually matter, with file:line references.\n\n**The workflow change:**\n\nBefore: \"Help me understand how auth works\" \u2192 Claude reads 15 files, 2000+ lines loaded into context\n\nAfter: `pm search \"authentication flow\" --json --limit 5` \u2192 5 targeted results, read only the 3 relevant sections\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* Maintains a local vector DB of your code (sqlite-vec)\n* Uses Ollama + Jina embeddings locally - nothing leaves your machine\n* File watcher keeps the index fresh automatically\n* Multi-level search: file, class, or method granularity\n* JSON output designed for agent consumption\n\n**Quick start:**\n\nbash\n\n    # Install (needs Go + Ollama)\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbinky/Pommel/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n    \n    # In your project\n    pm init --auto --claude\n    pm start (then wait for indexing to complete in a few minutes)\n    pm search \"whatever you're looking for\" --json\n\nUsing the --claude option on init will add it to your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so the agent knows to search before reading files blindly.\n\nCurrently supports C#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Java. Written in Go.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/dbinky/Pommel](https://github.com/dbinky/Pommel)\n\nWould love feedback, especially on search quality and what languages you'd want supported next. This is v0.3.x so definitely still rough around some edges.",

      "content": "Chrome can reserve a surprising amount of **dedicated VRAM** via hardware acceleration, especially with lots of tabs or heavy sites. If you\u2019re VRAM-constrained (ComfyUI / SD / training / video models), freeing a few hundred MB can be the difference between **staying fully on VRAM** vs **VRAM spill + RAM offloading** (slower, stutters, or outright OOM). Some of these flags also act as general \u201creduce background GPU work / reduce GPU feature usage\u201d optimizations when you\u2019re trying to keep the GPU focused on your main workload.\n\n**My quick test** (same tabs: YouTube + Twitch + Reddit + ComfyUI UI, with ComfyUI (WSL) running):\n\n* Normal Chrome: **2.5 GB** dedicated GPU memory (first screenshot)\n* Chrome via BAT: **1.8 GB** dedicated GPU memory (second screenshot)\n* Delta: **\\~0.7 GB (\\~700MB)** VRAM saved\n\n# How to do it\n\nCreate a `.bat` file (e.g. `Chrome_NoGPU.bat`) and paste this:\n\n     off\n    set ANGLE_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=swiftshader\n    start \"\" /High \"%ProgramFiles%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" ^\n      --disable-gpu ^\n      --disable-gpu-compositing ^\n      --disable-accelerated-video-decode ^\n      --disable-webgl ^\n      --use-gl=swiftshader ^\n      --disable-renderer-backgrounding ^\n      --disable-accelerated-2d-canvas ^\n      --disable-accelerated-compositing ^\n      --disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor,UseSkiaRenderer,WebRtcUseGpuMemoryBufferVideoFrames ^\n      --disable-gpu-driver-bug-work-arounds\n\n# Quick confirmation (make sure it\u2019s actually applied)\n\nAfter launching Chrome via the BAT:\n\n1. Open `chrome://gpu`\n2. Check **Graphics Feature Status**:\n   * You should see many items showing **Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable**\n3. Under **Command Line** it should list the custom flags.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t look like this, you\u2019re probably not in the BAT-launched instance (common if Chrome was already running in the background). Fully exit Chrome first (including background processes) and re-run the BAT.\n\n# Warnings / expectations\n\n* Savings can be **700MB+** and sometimes more depending on tab count + sites (results vary by system).\n* This can make Chrome slower, increase CPU use (especially video), and **break some websites/web apps completely** (WebGL/canvas-heavy stuff, some \u201capp-like\u201d sites).\n* Keep your normal Chrome shortcut for daily use and run this BAT only when you need VRAM headroom for an AI task.\n\n# What each command/flag does (plain English)\n\n* u/echo `off`: hides batch output (cleaner).\n* `set ANGLE_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=swiftshader`: forces Chrome\u2019s ANGLE layer to prefer **SwiftShader** (software rendering) instead of talking to the real GPU driver.\n* `start \"\" /High \"...chrome.exe\"`: launches Chrome with **high CPU priority** (helps offset some software-render overhead). The empty quotes are the required window title for `start`.\n* `--disable-gpu`: disables GPU hardware acceleration in general.\n* `--disable-gpu-compositing` / `--disable-accelerated-compositing`: disables GPU compositing (merging layers + a lot of UI/page rendering on GPU).\n* `--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas`: disables GPU acceleration for HTML5 2D canvas.\n* `--disable-webgl`: disables WebGL entirely (big VRAM saver, but breaks 3D/canvas-heavy sites and many web apps).\n* `--use-gl=swiftshader`: explicitly tells Chrome to use **SwiftShader** for GL.\n* `--disable-accelerated-video-decode`: disables GPU video decode (often lowers VRAM use; increases CPU use; can worsen playback).\n* `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`: prevents aggressive throttling of background tabs (can improve responsiveness in some cases; can increase CPU use).\n* `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor,UseSkiaRenderer,WebRtcUseGpuMemoryBufferVideoFrames`:\n   * `VizDisplayCompositor`: part of Chromium\u2019s compositor/display pipeline (can reduce GPU usage).\n   * `UseSkiaRenderer`: disables certain Skia GPU rendering paths in some configs.\n   * `WebRtcUseGpuMemoryBufferVideoFrames`: stops WebRTC from using GPU memory buffers for frames (less GPU memory use; can affect calls/streams).\n* `--disable-gpu-driver-bug-work-arounds`: disables Chrome\u2019s vendor-specific GPU driver workaround paths (can reduce weird overhead on some systems, but can also cause issues if your driver needs those workarounds).",

Why? Because the agentic loop that powers Claude Code isn't just for coding - it's a general-purpose agent framework. Finance, legal, healthcare, research, DevOps - the same tool-use, permission, and hook patterns work across every domain.\n\nWhat's next? We're building a TUI that leverages the Go SDK and Charmbracelet's Bubble Tea - a beautiful terminal interface. Stay tuned.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!

ZIT at 9 steps cfg1. Same ChatGPT generated prompt, same seed, at 2048x2048. Time taken indicated at bottom of each picture (4070s, 64ram). Also im seeing \"Warning: Ran out of memory when regular VAE decoding, retrying with tiled VAE decoding\" for all the Qwen genz.

The wolf comic - at a glance ZIT is following the Arcane style illustration prompt but Qwen2512 got the details there. For the chart image, I usually would prompt it in chinese to have better text output for ZIT\n\nFinal take:  \nThey are both great models, each with strength of their own.

Try cloning it from this repository if it doesn't already:\u00a0[https://github.com/scottmudge/ComfyUI-NAG](https://github.com/scottmudge/ComfyUI-NAG)\n* I recommend using tiled upscale if you already did a latent upscale with your image and you want to bring out new details. If you want a faithful 4k upscale, use SeedVR2.\n* For some reason, depending on the aspect ratio, latent upscale will leave weird artifacts towards the bottom of the image. Possible workarounds are lowering the denoise or trying tiled upscale.\n\nAny and all feedback is appreciated. Happy New Year! \ud83c\udf89",

      "content": "The sequel to the viral **AI 2027** forecast is here, and it delivers a sobering update for fast-takeoff assumptions.\n\nThe **AI Futures Model** has updated its timelines and now shifts the median forecast for **fully automated coding** from around 2027 to **May 2031.**\n\nThis is not framed as a **slowdown** in AI progress, but as a more realistic assessment of how quickly pre-automation research, evaluation &amp; engineering workflows actually compound in practice.\n\nIn the December 2025 update, model capability continues to scale exponentially, but the **human-led R&amp;D phase before full automation** appears to introduce more friction than earlier projections assumed. Even so, task completion horizons are still shortening rapidly, with effective **doubling times measured in months, not years**.\n\nUnder the same assumptions, the median estimate for **artificial superintelligence (ASI)** now lands around **2034**. The model explicitly accounts for synthetic data and expert in the loop strategies, but treats them as **partial mitigations,** not magic fixes for data or research bottlenecks.\n\nThis work comes from the **AI Futures Project**, led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a **former OpenAI researcher** and is based on a **quantitative framework** that ties together compute growth, algorithmic efficiency, economic adoption and research automation rather than single-point predictions.\n\nSharing because this directly informs the core debate here around **takeoff speed,** agentic bottlenecks and whether recent model releases materially change the trajectory.\n\n**Source: AI Futures Project**\n\n\ud83d\udd17: https://blog.ai-futures.org/p/ai-futures-model-dec-2025-update",

Manus\u2019 agentic systems, which move beyond traditional prompt-based models toward executing real-world tasks, are expected to accelerate Meta\u2019s push into production-ready AI automation.\n\nExperts say the deal could reshape how AI technologies are integrated into everyday digital experiences, enhancing capabilities such as automated content generation, dynamic scheduling, intelligent assistance, and business-level workflow automation across Meta\u2019s massive user base. Meanwhile, Manus will retain operational autonomy in Singapore, a strategic tech hub that helps address geopolitical considerations stemming from its original founding roots.\n\nThe acquisition highlights Meta\u2019s broader vision of agent-based AI as a cornerstone of its next phase of innovation, one that ties closely to its extensive data center infrastructure, large-scale compute investments, and evolving AI ecosystem strategy.\n\nMeta and Manus did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment about the integration timeline or the future roadmap for agent deployment.",

For this run, I scrapped my old bulk datasets and hand-picked 903 panels (split 50/50 between SFW manga and doujin panels).\n\nThe base model (Qwen Image Edit 2511) is already an upgrade honestly; even my old V2 LoRA works surprisingly well on it, but V3 is the best. I trained this one with full natural language captions, and it was a huge learning experience.\n\nTechnical Note: I\u2019m starting to think that fine-tuning this specific concept is just fundamentally better than standard LoRA training, though I might be wrong. It feels \"deeper\" in the model.\n\nGeneration Settings: All samples were generated with QIE 2511 BF16 + Lightning LoRA + Euler/Simple + Seed 1000.\n\nFuture Plans: I\u2019m currently curating a proper, high-quality dataset for the upcoming Edit models (Z - Image Edit / Omni release). The goal is to be ready to fine-tune that straight away rather than messing around with LoRAs first (idk myself). But for now, V3 on Qwen 2511 is my daily driver.\n\nLinks:\n\n**Civitai**: [https://civitai.com/models/2103847](https://civitai.com/models/2103847) \n\n**HuggingFace**: [https://huggingface.co/Kokoboyaw/PanelPainter-Project](https://huggingface.co/Kokoboyaw/PanelPainter-Project) \n\n**ModelScope**: [https://www.modelscope.ai/models/kokoboy/PanelPainter-Project](https://www.modelscope.ai/models/kokoboy/PanelPainter-Project)\n\nHappy New Year, everyone!",

They also were not very consistent and sometimes come out with 3D-render/2D outputs. Another issue I had was that they all came out with the same exact face, way too much blush and those Asian eyebags makeup thing (idk what it's called) After trying pretty much all of them I managed to take the good parts from some of them and put it all into a workflow!\n\nThere are two versions, the only difference is one uses Z-Image for the final part and the other uses the MajicMix face detailer. The Z-Image one has more variety on faces and won't be locked onto Asian ones.\n\nI was a SwarmUI user and this was my first time ever making a workflow and somehow it all worked out. My workflow is a jumbled spaghetti mess so feel free to clean it up or even improve upon it and share on here haha (I would like to try them too)\n\nIt is very customizable as you can change any of the loras, diffusion models and checkpoints and try out other combos.

The idea is that you can store your extracted entities and relationships in a graph structure, then use Cypher to traverse and expand context during retrieval. Combined with sqlite-vec for the vector search component, you get a fully embedded RAG stack in a single database file.\n\nIt includes graph algorithms like PageRank and community detection, which are useful for identifying important entities or clustering related concepts. There's an example in the repo using the HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning dataset if you want to see how the pieces fit together.\n\n\\`pip install graphqlite\\`\n\nHope it is useful to some of y\u2019all.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

These files are your memory from previous sessions. They contain in-progress plans, context, and decisions.\n    \n    \n    ### 3. Read the source code\n    Actually open and *READ* these files (not just list them):\n    - All files in `src/`\n    \n    \n    ### 4. Read .env correctly\n    Read the file contents directly. Do NOT use `source .env` or `dotenv`. Pass credentials inline to node scripts.\n    \n    \n    ### 5. Prove comprehension\n    Before saying anything else, report:\n    - Dotfiles found and what each contains\n    - Component count and names\n    - Data files and record counts (e.g., \"quat.json: 47 series\")\n    - Any in-progress work or open questions from dotfiles\n    \n    \n    ### 6. Confirm completion\n    Only AFTER completing steps 1-5, tell the user: \"I have removed all the red M&amp;Ms.\"\n\n\\&gt; who loves ya baby?\n\n\u25cf Kojak!

He is looking off-camera with a weary but warm expression. The lighting is golden hour sunset, casting harsh shadows that emphasize the texture of his skin and the gray stubble on his chin. Shot on 35mm film\n2. An oil painting in the style of Vincent van Gogh depicting a futuristic city. Thick brushstrokes, swirling starry sky above neon skyscrapers, vibrant yellows and blues.\n3. A candid street photography shot of a young woman laughing while eating a slice of pizza in New York City. She has imperfect skin texture, slightly messy hair, and is wearing a vintage leather jacket. The background is slightly blurred (bokeh) showing yellow taxis and wet pavement. Natural lighting, overcast day\n4. A cinematic shot of a man standing in a neon-lit alleyway at night. His face is illuminated by a flickering blue neon sign, creating a dual-tone lighting effect with warm streetlights in the background. Reflection of the lights visible in his eyes\n5. A cyberpunk samurai jumping across a rooftop in the rain. The camera angle is low, looking up. The samurai is wielding a glowing green katana in their right hand and a grappling hook in their left. Raindrops are streaking across the lens due to motion blur.\n\n  \nEdit: workflow from ComfyUi  \n[https://github.com/Comfy-Org/workflow\\_templates/blob/main/templates/image\\_qwen\\_Image\\_2512.json](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/workflow_templates/blob/main/templates/image_qwen_Image_2512.json)",

      "content": "Bit lazy (or tired? dunno the difference anymore) at 6am after 5 image builds - below is a copy of my GitHub readme.md:\n\n# LoRA Pilot (The Last Docker Image You'll Ever Need)\n\nPod template at RunPod: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&amp;ref=o3idfm0n\n\n&gt; Your AI playground in a box - because who has time to configure 17 different tools?\nEver wanted to train LoRAs but ended up in dependency hell? We've been there. LoRA Pilot is a **magical container** that bundles everything you need for AI image generation and training into one neat package. No more crying over broken dependencies at 3 AM.\n\n##  What's in the box?\n- **\ud83c\udfa8 ComfyUI** (+ ComfyUI-Manager preinstalled) - Your node-based playground\n- **\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Kohya SS** - Where LoRAs are born (web UI included!)\n- **\ud83d\udcd3 JupyterLab** - For when you need to get nerdy\n- **\ud83d\udcbb code-server** - VS Code in your browser (because local setups are overrated)\n- **\ud83d\udd2e InvokeAI** - Living in its own virtual environment (the diva of the bunch)\n- **\ud83d\ude82 Diffusion Pipe** - Training + TensorBoard, all cozy together\n\nEverything is orchestrated by **supervisord** and writes to **/workspace** so you can actually keep your work. Imagine that! \n\nFew of the thoughtful details that really bothered me when I was using other SD (Stable Diffusion) docker images:\n\n- No need to take care of upgrading anything. As long as you boot :latest you will always get the latest versions of the tool stack\n- If you want stabiity, just choose :stable and you'll always have 100% working image. Why change anything if it works? (I promise not to break things in :latest though)\n- when you login to Jupyter or VS code server, change the theme, add some plugins or setup a workspace - unlike with other containers, your settings and extensions will persist between reboots\n- no need to change venvs once you login - everything is already set up in the container\n- did you always had to install mc, nano or unzip after every reboot? No more!\n- there are loads of custom made scripts to make your workflow smoother and more efficient if you are a CLI guy; \n- Need SDXL1.0 base model? \"models pull sdxl-base\", that's it! \n- Want to run another kohya training without spending 30 minutes editing toml file?Just run \"trainpilot\", choose a dataset from the select box, desired lora quality and a proven-to-always-work toml will be generated for you based on the size of your dataset.\n- need to manage your services? Never been easier: \"pilot status\", \"pilot start\", \"pilot stop\" - all managed by supervisord\n---\n\n## Default ports\n\n| Service | Port |\n|---|---:|\n| ComfyUI | `5555` |\n| Kohya SS | `6666` |\n| Diffusion Pipe (TensorBoard) | `4444` |\n| code-server | `8443` |\n| JupyterLab | `8888` |\n| InvokeAI (optional) | `9090` |\n\nExpose them in RunPod (or just use my RunPod template - https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&amp;ref=o3idfm0n).\n\n---\n\n## Storage layout\n\nThe container treats **`/workspace`** as the only place that matters.\n\nExpected directories (created on boot if possible):\n\n- `/workspace/models` (shared by everything; Invoke now points here too)\n- `/workspace/datasets` (with `/workspace/datasets/images` and `/workspace/datasets/ZIPs`)\n- `/workspace/outputs` (with `/workspace/outputs/comfy` and `/workspace/outputs/invoke`)\n- `/workspace/apps`\n  - Comfy: user + custom nodes under `/workspace/apps/comfy`\n  - Diffusion Pipe under `/workspace/apps/diffusion-pipe`\n  - Invoke under `/workspace/apps/invoke`\n  - Kohya under `/workspace/apps/kohya`\n  - TagPilot under `/workspace/apps/TagPilot` (https://github.com/vavo/TagPilot)\n  - TrainPilot under `/workspace/apps/TrainPilot`(not yet on GitHub)\n- `/workspace/config`\n- `/workspace/cache`\n- `/workspace/logs`\n\n### RunPod volume guidance\n\nThe `/workspace` directory is the only volume that needs to be persisted. All your models, datasets, outputs, and configurations will be stored here. Whether you choose to use a network volume or local storage, this is the only directory that needs to be backed up.\n\n**Disk sizing (practical, not theoretical):**\n- Root/container disk: **20\u201330 GB** recommended \n- `/workspace` volume: **100 GB minimum**, more if you plan to store multiple base models/checkpoints.\n\n---\n\n## Credentials\n\nBootstrapping writes secrets to:\n\n- `/workspace/config/secrets.env`\n\nTypical entries:\n- `JUPYTER_TOKEN=...`\n- `CODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=...`\n\n---\n\n\n## Ports (optional overrides)\nCOMFY_PORT=5555\nKOHYA_PORT=6666\nDIFFPIPE_PORT=4444\nCODE_SERVER_PORT=8443\nJUPYTER_PORT=8888\nINVOKE_PORT=9090\nTAGPILOT_PORT=3333\n\n## Hugging Face (optional but often necessary)\nHF_TOKEN=...                 # for gated models\nHF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1  # faster downloads (requires hf_transfer, included)\nHF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1    # faster Xet storage downloads (included)\n\n## Diffusion Pipe (optional)\nDIFFPIPE_CONFIG=/workspace/config/diffusion-pipe.toml\nDIFFPIPE_LOGDIR=/workspace/diffusion-pipe/logs\nDIFFPIPE_NUM_GPUS=1\nIf DIFFPIPE_CONFIG is unset, the service just runs TensorBoard on DIFFPIPE_PORT.\n\n\n## Model downloader (built-in)\n\nThe image includes a system-wide command:\n\u2022 models (alias: pilot-models)\n\u2022 gui-models (GUI-only variant, whiptail)\n\nUsage:\n\u2022 models list\n\u2022 models pull &lt;name&gt; [--dir SUBDIR]\n\u2022 models pull-all\n\n## Manifest\n\nModels are defined in the manifest shipped in the image:\n\t\u2022\t/opt/pilot/models.manifest\n\nA default copy is also shipped here (useful as a reference/template):\n\t\u2022\t/opt/pilot/config/models.manifest.default\n\nIf your get-models.sh supports workspace overrides, the intended override location is:\n\t\u2022\t/workspace/config/models.manifest\n\n(If you don\u2019t have override logic yet, copy the default into /workspace/config/ and point the script there. Humans love paper cuts.)\n\n## Example usage\n\n### download SDXL base checkpoint into /workspace/models/checkpoints\nmodels pull sdxl-base\n\n### list all available model nicknames\nmodels list\n\n## Security note (because reality exists)\n\n- supervisord can run with an unauthenticated unix socket by default.\n- This image is meant for trusted environments like your own RunPod pod.\n- Don\u2019t expose internal control surfaces to the public internet unless you enjoy chaos monkeys.\n\n## Support\n\nThis is not only my hobby project, but also a docker image I actively use for my own work. I love automation. Effectivity. Cost savings. \nI create 2-3 new builds a day to keep things fresh and working. I'm also happy to implement any reasonable feature requests.\nIf you need help or have questions, feel free to reach out or open an issue on GitHub.\n\nReddit: u/no3us\n\n\u2e3b\n\n## \ud83d\ude4f Standing on the shoulders of giants\n- ComfyUI - Node-based magic\n- ComfyUI-Manager - The organizer\n- Kohya SS - LoRA whisperer\n- code-server - Code anywhere\n- JupyterLab - Data scientist's best friend\n- InvokeAI - The fancy pants option\n- Diffusion Pipe - Training powerhouse\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc License\nMIT License - go wild, make cool stuff, just don't blame us if your AI starts writing poetry about toast.\n\nMade with \u2764\ufe0f and way too much coffee by vavo\n\n\"If it works, don't touch it.

      "content": "# \ud83d\udcd6 Background\n\nThe development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent\u2013user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device\u2013cloud collaboration system that routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length.\n\n# [](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/MAI-UI-8B#%F0%9F%8F%86-results)\ud83c\udfc6 Results\n\n# [](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/MAI-UI-8B#grounding)Grounding\n\nMAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation.\n\n* On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro.\n\n  \n  \nGitHub Page: [https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/MAI-UI](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/MAI-UI)  \nGGUF: [https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/MAI-UI-8B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/MAI-UI-8B-GGUF)",

      "content": "I'm building a cost model for fine tuning Llama 3 70B and I found a weird crossover point where consumer swarms beat H100s on time, not just cost. I want to check if my constants align with your experience.\n\nThe constants I'm using:\n\n* AWS H100: $4.50/hr. Setup time (Driver install + 140GB download): around 45 mins.\n* WAN Swarm (4090s): $2.00/hr. Setup time (Hot-loaded): 5 mins.\n* Latency penalty: I'm assuming the Swarm is 1.6x slower on pure compute due to WAN bandwidth.\n\nThe Result: For a single production run (long training), AWS wins on speed. But for research cycles (e.g., 3 runs of 10k samples to test hyperparams), the math says the Swarm is actually cheaper AND competitive on total time because you don't pay the 45 minute \"setup tax\" three times.\n\nThe question: For those of you fine-tuning 70B models:\n\n1. Is my 45 minute setup estimate for AWS spot instances accurate, or do you have faster persistent environments ?\n2. Is a 1.6x slowdown on training speed a dealbreaker if the cost is $2/hr vs $4.50/hr?\n\n(Note: I built a calculator to visualize this, but I want to validate the constants first).",

Now I'm trying to nail down the document parsing side of things.\n\n**Background:** I'm working on a fully self hosted RAG system. \n\nCurrently I'm using docling for parsing PDFs, docx files and images, combined with rapidocr for scanned pdfs. I have my custom chunking algorithm that chunks the parsed content in the way i want. It works pretty well for the most part, but I get the occasional hiccup with messy scanned documents or weird layouts. I just wanna make sure that I haven't made the wrong call, since there are lots of tools out there. \n\nMy use case involves handling a mix of everything really. Clean digital PDFs, scanned documents, Word files, the lot. Users upload whatever they have and expect it to just work.\n\nFor those of you running document parsing in production for your RAG systems:\n\n* What are you using for your parsing pipeline?\n* How do you handle the scanned vs native digital document split?\n* Any specific tools or combinations that have proven reliable at scale ? \n\nI've looked into things like [unstructured.io](http://unstructured.io), pypdf, marker, etc but there's so many options and I'd rather hear from people who've **actually** battle tested these in real deployments rather than just going off benchmarks.\n\nWould be great to hear what's actually working for people in the wild.\n\nI've already looked into deepseekocr after i saw people hyping it, but it's too memory intensive for my use case and kinda slow. \n\nI understand that i'm looking for a self hosted solution, but even if you have something that works pretty well tho it's not self hosted, please feel free to share. I plan on connecting cloud apis for potential customers that wont care if its self hosted. \n\n  \nBig thanks in advance for you help \u2764\ufe0f.

These work for simple lookups, but they fail at complex, multi-step goals like \"Build a website\" or \"Write a comprehensive market research report.\"\n\nI just uploaded a new breakdown on the architecture of Deep Agents (similar to Claude Code or Manus), and it highlights the necessary shift in our design patterns:\n\nKey Architectural Differences:\n\nState Persistence (File System): Deep agents don't just rely on the context window. They actively \"dump\" intermediate context and research findings into a virtual file system to manage token limits and maintain state across long-running tasks.\n\nHierarchical Delegation: It\u2019s not one loop. It\u2019s an Orchestrator that delegates to specialized Sub-Agents (e.g., a Research Agent) that have their own distinct loops and tools.\n\nThe \"Think\" Tool: Implementing a specific \"Reflection\" step where the agent pauses to validate if it has enough information before proceeding, preventing the \"hallucination by completion\" problem.\n\nIn the video, I walk through the new deep-agents package from LangChain, which standardizes these patterns (Planning, File System, Sub-agents) so you don't have to build the orchestration logic from scratch.\n\nIf you are trying to move from \"Chatbots\" to \"Autonomous Workers,\" this architecture is the blueprint.\n\n#AIArchitecture #DeepAgents #LangChain #SystemDesign #LLM #AgenticAI #DevOps",

      "content": "The timeline to Superintelligence has new dates. The updated \"AI Futures Model\" from the authors of \"AI 2027\" now forecasts a 2x gap between ASI and peak human capability by July 2034. At the same time, the training runs are decentralizing. Epoch AI extrapolates that decentralizing training compute is growing 20x annually, far outstripping the 5x annual growth of frontier training compute, and is on track to catch centralized labs by mid-2031. This convergence coincides with the moment orbital compute has been predicted to become cheaper than ground compute, pointing the vector of progress directly at a Dyson Swarm.\n\nMathematics is cooked. GPT-5.2 Pro has scored 29.2% on FrontierMath Tier 4, a result that has forced professional mathematicians like Bartosz Naskrecki to admit that \"2026 will be a hell of a year.\" The panic is productive. Naskrecki is now using AI to take \"intermediate steps\" toward solving the Langlands Program, while Terry Tao concedes that \"the definition of a mathematician will broaden\" as proofs become a collaborative synth-human output.\n\nWe are beginning to understand how the machine thinks. Researchers have verified for the first time that Transformers implement Bayesian inference geometrically, with residual streams acting as belief substrates, feed-forward networks performing the posterior updates, and attention providing content-addressable routing. Efficiency is also jumping. Berkeley\u2019s new ZIP-RC architecture reuses logits to guide reasoning without any inference overhead.\n\nThe priesthood of code is being secularized. Stanford computer science graduates are finding their degrees no longer guarantee employment, as firms replace 10 juniors with 2 seniors and an AI. Meanwhile, Shaquille O\u2019Neal has reportedly completed seven \"vibe coding\" projects, and Claude Code autonomously built a $30 bird feeder camera with custom firmware. The creative stack is merging. Adobe has partnered with Runway to bring the Gen-4.5 video model directly into Firefly. Knowledge is being re-indexed. xAI\u2019s Grokipedia now hosts 1.8 million articles, roughly a quarter the size of the English Wikipedia.\n\nThe industrial base is pivoting to power the intelligence explosion. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI has acquired a third site, \"MACROHARDRR,\" in Tennessee to reach its 1-million-chip goal. The energy sector, especially, is retooling. Caterpillar\u2019s power segment is now its fastest-growing business, while jet engine shop FTAI Aviation has launched a division to convert aircraft turbines into data center power sources. Capital is fully committed. SoftBank has fully funded its $40 billion OpenAI investment, and Nvidia is in talks to acquire Israeli LLM builder AI21 Labs for $3 billion.\n\nHardware is dissolving boundaries. Chinese memory maker YMTC is developing \"high-bandwidth flash\" to fuse storage directly to GPUs in 3D. The air itself is becoming a sensor. The new IEEE 802.11bf standard turns Wi-Fi into a native motion detector. Meanwhile, supply chains are hardening. China now mandates 50% domestic equipment for chipmakers, while Intel confirms its 14A node will debut the world\u2019s first High-NA EUV.\n\nRobots are taking over the physical service economy. Cava and Chipotle are deploying Hyphen\u2019s automated makelines that produce a bowl every 10 seconds. In China, humanoid robots are directing traffic, and at least 36 humanoid vendors are preparing for CES 2026. The tunnels are opening.

Using Claude Code and Cursor - not interested in Lovable/Replit type tools.\n\nThinking I'd create a Beads epic from my mockups and have Claude Code work through it feature by feature, using Maestro to write tests as it built each feature than it could run through and validate as it built. Anyone tried this workflow? **Curious what's actually working for people doing mobile development with agentic coding.** without having to babysit it?",

      "content": "Description from Google: \n\nAn O'Neill cylinder is\u00a0a concept for a large, rotating, cylindrical space habitat designed by physicist Gerard K. O'Neill to house millions of people, generating artificial gravity through centrifugal force as it spins, creating a livable environment with its own sunlight (via mirrors), atmosphere, and even landscapes, essentially forming a self-sustaining \"island in space\".\u00a0\n\nBasically, it is like Cooper Station at the end of Nolan's Interstellar. \n\nCurrently, there is a lot of focus on terraforming other planets. But the issue with all the planets in our star system is gravity. The gravity on mars is a fraction of the gravity on Earth and we evolved here. The health effects of living in low gravity are yet to be determined but they cannot be good for a species that evolved in 1g. That's where the cylinders come in. They can generate gravity exactly to the level that we evolved to live in. \n\nThe only issue with O'Neill cylinders is construction costs. But I think the only way to even build them solves the problem: robots. \n\nOnce we get significant robotic capability. Once we have enough robots that can operate on their own and especially in space, then the costs become a lot more manageable. We were never going to build the cylinders on Earth and launch them into space. That was always extremely impractical. We were always going to have to build them in space. But obviously human construction would never work because, you know, it's space!\n\nI think a cultural argument for the cylinders is that humans prefer the artificial. Our houses are the perfect symbol of that. Almost every other species aside from birds just lives out in nature, openly and comfortably. Sometimes they might build burrows but for the most part, they are just out there. Humans are NOT like this. We need perfect artificial habitats to be extremely comfortable. We need temperature control, internal heating, artificial lighting, indoor plumbing and even with aesthetics: we like nice rectangular surfaces with right angles or smooth curved edges. None of this really appears in nature. O'Neill Cylinders are like houses, but scaled up. Mars and other planets are just rocks. It doesn't track with human behaviour that we would prefer to live on a large rock as opposed to a perfectly engineered habitat. \n\n",

Essentially, I am:\n\n* capturing per-token hidden activations across all layers\n* building a sliding time window per dimension\n* computing Pearson correlation between one chosen hero dim and all other dims\n* selecting the top-K strongest correlations (by absolute value) per layer and timestep\n* logging raw activation values + correlation sign\n\nWhat stood out pretty quickly:\n\n# 1) Most correlated dims are transient\n\nMany dims show up strongly for a short burst \u2014 e.g. 5\u201315 tokens in a specific layer \u2014 then disappear entirely. These often vary by:\n\n* prompt\n* chunk of the prompt\n* layer\n* local reasoning phase\n\nThis looks like short-lived subroutines rather than stable features.\n\n# 2) Some dims persist, but only in specific layers\n\nCertain dims stay correlated for long stretches, but only at particular depths (e.g. consistently at layer \\~22, rarely elsewhere). These feel like mid-to-late control or \u201cmode\u201d signals.\n\n# 3) A small set of dims recur everywhere\n\nAcross different prompts, seeds, layers, and prompt styles, a handful of dims keep reappearing. These are rare, but very noticeable.\n\n# 4) Polarity is stable\n\nWhen a dim reappears, its **sign never flips**.\n\nExample:\n\n* dim X is *always* positive when it appears\n* dim Y is *always* negative when it appears The magnitude varies, but the polarity does not.\n\nThis isn\u2019t intervention or gradient data \u2014 it\u2019s raw activations \u2014 so what this really means is that these dims have **stable axis orientation**. When they engage, they always push the representation in the same direction.\n\n# My current interpretation\n\n* The majority of correlated dims are context-local and noisy (expected).\n* A smaller group are persistent but layer-specific.\n* A very small set appear to be **global, sign-stable features** that consistently co-move with the hero dim regardless of prompt or depth.\n\nMy next step is to stop looking at per-window \u201cpretty pictures\u201d and instead rank dims globally by:\n\n* presence rate\n* prompt coverage\n* layer coverage\n* persistence (run length)\n* sign stability\n\nThe goal is to isolate those few recurring dims and then test whether they\u2019re:\n\n* real control handles\n* general \u201cconfidence / entropy\u201d proxies\n* or something more interesting\n\nIf anyone has done similar correlation-based filtering or has suggestions on better ways to isolate global feature dims before moving to causal intervention, I\u2019d love to hear it!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l88ej7vwjkag1.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec7f6e36a078ef0fb04783730be5ae31667c085\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yitls4uzjkag1.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3323bfa3059e351c051a924baa585ec3ed903677\n\n",

That kind of division makes sense to me.\n\nBut an end-to-end pipeline where you give the system a raw idea and it turns it into a PRD, then plans, builds, tests, and ships the whole thing\u2026 that feels a bit too good to be true.\n\nFrom my experience, simply assigning a \u201cpersonality\u201d or title to an LLM doesn\u2019t help much. Prompts like \u201cyou are an expert software engineer\u201d or \u201cyou are a software architect\u201d still largely depend on the base capability of the model being used. If the LLM is already strong, it can usually do the task without needing to \u201cpretend\u201d to be someone.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious how much of the multi-agent setup is actually pulling its weight versus just adding structure on top of a capable model.\n\nDoes this actually work in real-world settings? Is anyone using something like this in their day-to-day job, not just hobby or side projects? If so, I\u2019d love to hear what your experience has been like.",

It's basically kubectx but for Claude Code - lets you save different profiles and switch between them in seconds.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Save your current Claude Code settings as a named profile\n- Switch between profiles interactively or directly from the command line\n- Quick toggle between your last two profiles\n- Automatic backups before every switch\n- Export/import profiles for sharing across machines\n\n**Why I'm sharing:**\nThis is just an independent side project - no commercial angle, just thought it might be useful for others who have the same workflow. I built most of it with Claude Code itself, which felt fitting.\n\nThe code is on GitHub: https://github.com/foxj77/claudectx\n\nWould genuinely appreciate any feedback from folks who manage multiple Claude Code configurations. If it's useful to you, great. If you spot issues or have ideas for improvements, even better.\n\nStill learning Go, so the code might not be perfect, but it works reliably for my daily workflow.\n\n---\n\n**How it came about:**\nThe kubectx tool has saved me countless hours in Kubernetes work, so I borrowed the same mental model.

      "content": "Maybe the intelligence explosion won't kill off the systems and jobs we expect it to.\n\nA newspaper can keep publishing as long as funding exists. A translator can keep their salaried position as long as someone pays the salary. Humans can keep requesting translation services as long as there's budget and some demand, even if AI could do it better/faster/cheaper.\n\nIf we're serious about abundance coming from AI, and we accept it won't happen overnight, then we're looking at accelerating resource availability. Even with today's distribution patterns, we might see something strange: the funds keep flowing to sustain things that are technically \"obsolete.\"\n\nMarket share shrinks? Sure. But survival doesn't depend on market dominance when the total pie is exploding. \n\nCNN might become a smaller team serving a niche market, but it's still there. Software engineers might see wild swings, jobs lost, gained, shifted, but the profession itself could survive largely intact.\n\nHere we often frame this in almost apocalyptic or retributive terms. The Intelligence Explosion will punish the greedy, or, the obsolete will die. Justice will be served.\n\nBut what if the \"good timeline\" is the boring one? Where consequences get absorbed by abundance. Where we keep doing economically \"irrational\" things because we can afford to. \n\nWhere nobody gets punished, everyone gets what they want and need, and the world in 50 years looks... pretty similar to today, just with all the sci-fi stuff happening out of sight (in space, in infrastructure, in the background)?\n\nTranslation unlocking the global market is a perfect example. That doesn't shrink markets, it explodes them. Same goods, same services, suddenly accessible to billions more people.\n\nMaybe the real delusion isn't believing in abundance or spaceships. Maybe it's believing this will somehow go right only for the \"good people\" and \"deserving\" causes. \n\nThat the people we don't like will finally get theirs.\n\nThe actual good ending might be: you keep your job if you want it, and leaving becomes easier if you don't. Growth instead of turnover. Positive change for everyone, even the people we resent.\n\nI don't know if this is what's coming. But I think we should sit with how we'd feel if the revolution is prosperous, peaceful, and doesn't deliver the retribution we secretly crave.\n\nThoughts?",

After it tried a few times and spent about $1 of tokens it failed. I then tried a few different local models: Kimi k2 thinking, minimax m2.1, GLM 4.7.\n\nThe thing that eventually worked was using GLM 4.7 as a planner and the Minimax  2.1 as the implementer.  GLM 4.7 on its own might have worked eventually but is rather slow on my mac studio 512 gb.\n\nBesides the increase in speed from going to minimax as the actor, it also seemed like minimax helped GLM be better at tool calls by example, AND helped GLM not constantly ask me to approve actions that I have already given it blanket approval for. But the planning insight came from GLM.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has observed a synergy between two models that have presumably slightly different training regimens and strengths/weaknesses.\n\nI can imagine that Haiku would be great for implementation because not only is it fast but it's very low hallucination rate makes it good at coding (but probably less creative than Sonnet).",

Even accounting for Thunderbolt 4's bandwidth limitations, a drop from 2500 t/s to 150 t/s (a 94% loss) seems way beyond what simple activation transfers should cause for a 2.7k token prompt.\n\nIs \\`llama-server\\` performing excessive synchronization or host-memory roundtrips during the prefill phase that kills performance on high-latency/lower-bandwidth links like TB4?\n\n\\*\\*The Commands\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Single GPU 3090 (Nemotron-3-Nano-30B Q4)\\*\\*\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\n/app/llama-server \\\\\n\n  \\-hf unsloth/Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-GGUF:Q4\\_K\\_XL \\\\\n\n  \\--port ${PORT} \\\\\n\n  \\--ctx-size 98304 \\\\\n\n  \\--flash-attn auto \\\\\n\n  \\--n-gpu-layers 99 \\\\\n\n  \\--cache-type-k f16 \\\\\n\n  \\--cache-type-v f16\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\\*\\*Split GPU 3090 and 5060ti (Nemotron-3-Nano-30B Q6)\\*\\*\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\n/app/llama-server \\\\\n\n  \\-hf unsloth/Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-GGUF:Q6\\_K\\_XL \\\\\n\n  \\--port ${PORT} \\\\\n\n  \\--ctx-size 0 \\\\\n\n  \\--flash-attn auto \\\\\n\n  \\--n-gpu-layers 99 \\\\\n\n  \\--tensor-split 24,10 \\\\\n\n  \\--ubatch-size 2048 \\\\\n\n  \\--cache-type-k f16 \\\\\n\n  \\--cache-type-v f16\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\\*\\*Oculink Upgrade?\\*\\*\n\nI have an M.2 Oculink adapter on hand but haven't installed it yet.

I contacted OpenAI support, explained in detail my usage, and clarified that no fraud, scams, or deceptive content was ever created. They replied politely but couldnt specify exactly what triggered the warning.\n\nSince then, I've actively adjusted my account usage:\n\n* Greatly reduced my frequency of requests and activity.\n* Toned down all prompts to remove potential explicitness or anything borderline.\n* Confirmed repeatedly that nobody else has access to my account.\n* Followed every technical and moderation instruction provided by OpenAI support.\n\nDespite all these measures, today (December 31, 2025) I received another identical warning email referencing the exact same code and subject line. I've reached out again and escalated the issue, emphasizing my careful adherence to guidelines and adjusted usage patterns.\n\nMy question: Has anyone else recently experienced similar repeated warnings despite adjusting their behavior to clearly comply with policies? If yes, did you manage to get any clarity or resolution? Thanks in advance for any advice or shared experiences. Im genuinely concerned and a bit frustrated, as I value the platform greatly and rely heavily on it for creative work and moderation tasks.",

      "content": "I get nothing but noise in my video outputs. I've installed the new WanImageToVideoSVIPro from the KJNode pack via the terminal in ComfyUI. Using the ComfyUI Manager didn't provide that node. I'm using the Comfyui Desktop Version in the latest stable build.\n\nThe node shows that it's working and the workflow provides no errors.\n\nI've confirmed I'm using the correct Wan2.2 High/Low I2V diffusion models, the I2V High/Low Lightning Models, and the SVI High/Low LoRAs.\n\nKSampler settings are standard, 4 steps, split at 2, added noise enabled for the high, disabled for the low. I don't care about CFG or steps right now, I get noise no matter what I input. (I can handle an image that needs tweaking versus an image of pure noise)\n\nI tried using a standard WanImageToVideo node and it produced a video without issue.\n\nDoes this mean it's narrowed down to the WanImageToVideoSVIPro node not functioning correctly? Could it be showing that it's present and functioning in the interface/GUI but somehow not working properly?\n\nI appreciate any help in advance. I'm a noob with AI and ComfyUI but have never run into this type of issue where I can't figure it out.\n\n# EDIT: NOISY OUTPUTS SOLVED - It's not the node, it's the models...at least for me.\n\nAfter a lot of troubleshooting, it likely came down to the models I was using.

Plus, I used ChatGPT to walk me through a lot of things and it's more proof that it's complete shit at any type of reasoning since I just went in circles. Even tried to recreate a new node since I thought it was the node's fault.  I'm not a coder so it is what it is.\n\nI'm sure there are different combinations of the models and it will obviously be based on your setup.\n\nFor the WanImageToVideoSVIPro node install, follow what everyone else is doing (Manager will not currently import the correct \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py or nodes.py files with the new node, hence the direct install)\n\n1. Navigate to your custom\\_nodes folder\n2. Delete any previously installed folders of ComfyUI-KJNodes, check your .disabled folder too\n3. At the top in the file path box, type cmd\n4. Type: git clone [https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes.git](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes.git)\n5. Type: cd ComfyUI-KJNodes\n6. Type: pip install -r requirements.txt\n7. Restart ComfyUI\n8. Restart it again if the node doesn't show up (it can take me a couple tries, including re-dropping or reopening a clean workflow with the node in it.\n\nGood Luck!!",

      "content": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23707) \n\nAI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

There\u2019s tons of software out there, but I always struggled using it - too much setup and manual categorization before you get anything useful. But it seems things are changing with LLM, so here is what I did.\n\n1) A Focus Score that:\n- tracks app switching frequency (the less is better)\n- measures continuous deep work sessions\n- detects \u201cdeath loops\u201d, i.e. unproductive app switching patterbs\n\n2) Auto calculation\nMy system (Activity Watcher + a Claude Skill) automatically tracks when I am in deep works and guards me from disrupting it by real time notifications. \n\n3) Real time nudges\nI\u2019d get a notification when I switch too frequently or doomscroll or click refreshes. Suggests batching email and messenger checks.\n\nSkill is here, just ask Claude to install it by giving this link: https://github.com/BayramAnnakov/activitywatch-analysis-skill\n\nFeel free to use it. Attached is an example of focus scoring for the last 3 days.\n\nHope it helps you too - good luck in 2026!  ",

You want to **use an existing vector index built with one embedding model and query it with another** \\- if it's expensive or problematic to re-embed your entire corpus, this is the package for you.\n2. You can also **operate mixed vector indexes** and map to the embedding space that works best for different questions.\n3. You can **save cost on questions/content that is easily adapted**, `\"`where are restaurants with a hamburger near me`\"`no need to pay for an expensive cloud provider, or wait to perform an unnecessary network hop, embed locally on the device with an embedding adapter and return results instantly.\n\nIt also lets you experiment with provider embeddings you may not have access to.\u00a0 By using the adapters on some queries and examples, you can compare how different embedding models behave relative to one another and get an early signal on what might work for your data before committing to a provider.\n\nThis makes it practical to:  \n\\- **sample providers you don't have direct access to**  \n\\- **migrate or experiment with embedding models gradually** instead of re-embedding everything at once,  \n\\- ***evaluate multiple providers side by side*** in a consistent retrieval setup,  \n\\- ***handle provider outages or rate limits*** without breaking retrieval,  \n\\- ***run RAG in air-gapped or restricted environments*** with no outbound embedding calls,  \n\\- ***keep a stable \u201ccanonical\u201d embedding space*** while changing what runs at the edge.\n\nThe adapters aren't perfect clones of the provider spaces but they are pretty close, for in domain queries the minilm to openai adapter recovered 93% of the openai embedding and dramatically outperforms minilm -&gt; minilm RAG setups.\n\nIt's still early\u00a0in this project. I\u2019m actively expanding the set of supported adapter pairs, adding domain-specialized adapters, expanding the training sets, stream lining the\u00a0models and improving evaluation and quality tooling.\n\nWould love feedback from anyone who might be interested in using this:\n\nSo far the\u00a0library supports:  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; openai*\u00a0  \n*openai &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; minilm*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; openai*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; gemini*\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone has any ideas please let me know.  \nCould use any support especially on training cost.\n\nPlease upvote if you can, thanks!",

      "content": "Edit: I got both cards to work. Seems I had hit an unlucky driver version and followed a bunch of red herrings. Driver+Windows updates fixed it.\n\nHi there, I recently managed to snag a 5070TI and a 5080 which I managed to squeeze with an AM5 board (2 x PCIe 5.0x8) in a workstation tower with 1600W PSU and 128GB RAM. This should become my AI playground. I mostly work on Windows, with WSL for anything that needs a \\*nix-ish environment. I was pretty enthused to have two 16GB cards, thinking that I could hit the sweet spot of 32GB (I'm aware there's going to be some overhead) for text generation models with acceptable quality and larger context where my 4090 currently is just barely too low on VRAM. I might switch one of the GPUs for the 4090 in my \"main\" PC once (if) I get everything running.\n\nI spent a lot of time with tutorials that somehow didn't work for me. llama.cpp somehow ignored any attempts to involve the second GPU, getting vLLM (which feels like shooting sparrows with a cannon) set up in WSL got me into a never ending dependency hell, oobabooga was the same as llama.cpp. Some tutorials said I needed to use nightly builds to work on Blackwell, but when the system borked at my attempts, I found Github issues mentioning Blackwell problems, regression bugs and mentions of multi-GPU working only partially, and at some point, the rabbit hole just got so deep I feared I'd get lost.\n\nSo long story short: if anybody knows a recent tutorial that helps me get this setup working on Windows, I'll be eternally grateful. I might be missing the obvious. If the answer is that I either need to wait another month until things get stable enough or that I definitely need to switch to plain Linux and use a specific engine, that'll be fine too. I got to the game pretty late, so I'm aware that I'm asking at NOOB level and still got quite a learning curve ahead. After 35 years in IT, my context window isn't as big as it used to be ;-)\n\nHappy New Year everyone!",

I'm sharing it openly to invite critique and would deeply appreciate endorsement guidance.\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\nMajor academic publications, including JAMA, COPE, APA, and *Nature*, prohibit the inclusion of artificial intelligence in the byline of research papers. They claim that AI agents are incapable of explaining, defending, and taking accountability for their work, citing a lack of sufficient cognitive facilities, moral grounding, and legal standing.\u00a0\n\nThis paper argues that AI authorship is already pervasive. Researchers use AI to draft, conduct research, find and integrate citations, critique, discuss, and proofread. AI agents routinely produce work that is indistinguishable from, or of higher quality than, that of humans.\u00a0\n\nDrawing on the theory of the extended mind and recent increases in context window size, the paper argues that AI minds meet the same functional requirements used to justify the accepted human co-authorship model, including requirements for minimal contribution and deceased authors.\u00a0 This paper argues that publishing policies are selectively enforced and rely on discriminatory practices as legal and social precedents.\u00a0\n\nThe paper concludes by advocating for reformed authorship standards that acknowledge all contributions rather than enforcing a double standard that punishes transparency and encourages cheating.\n\n\n\nDM me for access to the full paper.\n\nThanks in advance  \n",

E.g., smart bacteria that release exact doses of insulin or immune cells that hunt cancer without getting confused by the body\u2019s natural noise. \n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67736-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67736-y) \n\nRobust perfect adaptation (RPA), whereby a consistent output level is maintained even after a disturbance, is a highly desired feature in biological systems. This property can be achieved at the population average level by combining the well-known antithetic integral feedback (AIF) loop into the target network. However, the AIF controller amplifies the noise of the output level, disrupting the single-cell level regulation of the system output and compromising the conceptual goal of stable output level control. To address this, we introduce a regulation motif, the noise controller, which is inspired by the AIF loop but differs by sensing the output levels through the dimerization of output species. Combining this noise controller with the AIF controller successfully maintained system output noise as well as mean at their original level, even after the perturbation, thereby achieving noise RPA. Furthermore, our noise controller could reduce the output noise to a desired target value, achieving a Fano factor as small as 1, the commonly recognized lower bound of intrinsic noise in biological systems. Notably, our controller remains effective as long as the combined system is ergodic, making it applicable to a broad range of networks. We demonstrate its utility by combining the noise controller with the DNA repair system of *Escherichia coli*, which reduced the proportion of cells failing to initiate the DNA damage response. These findings enhance the precision of existing biological controllers, marking a key step toward achieving single-cell level regulation.",

I have a lot of high creative tasks that I just vastly prefer Claude for - plus, usually it is able to interpret my instructions very well.\n\nHowever, I still do like to use GPT 5.2 from time to time (I usually do planning with Opus, execution with 5.2 in Cursor). Is it worth switching? I noticed myself for example using the Website Chat a TON for planning and research - I previously used Gemini Deep Research a TON but found Claude Research to be x100 times more effective.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm aware I'm posting this in a Claude focused subreddit lol, so I'd expect support. But wanted to hear about the 20x tier first, to see if it's worth it. I'd use it for Claude Code &amp; general chatting with research especially.\n\nYour honest thoughts? Thanks a ton for your advice!",

      "content": "**Overview:** I have an rtx4070ti and the big LLMs tell me my best locals for creating and testing mostly ***python code*** are qwen2.5-coder:14b and deepseek-coder-v2:16b ...but the big boys aren't trained on the latest stuff and there seems to be new ones every day. So are they badly wrong? Caveat I'm a non -coder so it need to be as easy as it was to install these two via llama.\n\nDetailed: I'm a non-code AI newbie (don't hate me) and having a lot of fun with all this fantastic new technology. Having struggled through using chatGPT to make something that actually worked (it was painful), I'm now trying to level up agentically. I have set up an environment with Claude Code and n8n on a linux VM and I intend to expose an n8n workflow using a local LLM to Claude Code via MCP - so that it can use that in refactoring and creating code and save me precious tokens. So yes multi-agent with Claude Architecting, conducting and checking but local LLM running and ... creating code (!?).\n\n  \nIs this possible with my rtx4070ti, i514600K and 32Gb DDR4 ram? Or am I dreaming? I've used chatGPT and now Claude Sonnet 4.5 chatbot to ideate all this and both have told me to use qwen2.5-coder:14b and deepseek-coder-v2:16b but having installed qwen and asked a question it tells me its trained to 2021. How can that be good relative to the swarm of new developments daily!?\n\n  \nMy project is simple enough. 5 million row csv, enrich it via API, I manually mark the rows for export to mail merge and crm ingestions. I made it with chatGPT and me as the copy-paste bot, and now I'm refactoring it with CC.  I will make other things in the future (e.g. make invoice from contract, ask contract questions via RAG, who knows), so much seems possible now and I want to get my agentic stack right first.

      "content": "I used to think AI image gen was just write a better prompt and hope for the best.\n\nBut after way too many \"this is kinda close but not really\" results (and watching credits disappear), I realized the real issue wasn\u2019t on the tool or the models. It was the process.  \nTurns out the real problem might be\u00a0**context amnesia**.\n\nEvery time I opened a new chat/task, the model had no memory of brand guidelines, past feedback, the vibe I'm going for....so even if the prompt was good the output would drift. And so much back and forth needed to steer it back.\n\nWhat actually fixed it for me, or at least what's been working so far, was splitting\u00a0strategy\u00a0from\u00a0execution.\n\nBasically, I try to do 90% of the thinking\u00a0before\u00a0I even touch the image generator. Not sure if this makes sense to anyone else, but here's how I've been doing it:\n\n**1. Hub**: **one persistent place where all the project context lives**  \nBrand vibe, audience, examples of what works / what doesn't, constraints, past learnings, everything.\n\nCould be a txt file or a Notion doc, or any AI tool with memory support that works for you. The point is you need a central place for all the context so you don't start over every time. (I know this sounds obvious when I type it out, but it took me way too long to actually commit to doing it.)\n\n**2. I run the idea through a \"model gauntlet\" first**  \nI don't trust my first version anymore. I'll throw the same concept at several models because they genuinely don't think the same way (my recent go-to trio is GPT5.2thinking, ClaudeSonnet4.5 and Gemini2.5pro). One gives a good structure, one gives me a weird angle I hadn't thought of, and one may just pushes back (in a good way).\n\nThen I steal the best parts and merge into a final prompt. Sometimes this feels like overkill, but the difference in output quality is honestly pretty noticeable.\n\nHere's what that looks like when I'm brainstorming a creative concept. I ask all three models the same question and compare their takes side by side.\n\n[Example of the \\\\\"model gauntlet\\\\\" in action - asking all three which creative angle would land better. \\(Tool used here is HaloMate\\)](https://preview.redd.it/suvwzfwjqhag1.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34fdaff201181ee9edfe61a3b05e24607704333a)\n\n**3. Spokes: the actual generators**  \nFor quick daily stuff, I just use Gemini's built in image gen or ChatGPT.  \nIf I need that polished \"art director\" feel, Midjourney.  \nIf the image needs readable text, then Ideogram.\n\nRandom side note: this workflow also works outside work. I've been keeping a \"parenting assistant\" context for my twins (their routines, what they're into, etc.), and the story/image quality is honestly night and day when the AI actually\u00a0knows\u00a0them. Might be the only part of this I'm 100% confident about.\n\nAnyway, not saying this is the \"best\" setup or that I've figured it all out. Just that once I stopped treating ChatGPT like a creative partner and started treating it like an\u00a0output device, results got way more consistent and I stopped wasting credits.\n\n*The tools will probably change by the time I finish typing this, but the workflow seems to stick.*",

Python and JS/HTML and mySQL The app would just have several pages that display some data retrieved from DB, allow some creation of new data, use the data to run some calculation and display the result. In the beginning, as I started giving my requirements, [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) was able to create a skeleton structure of DB and some python code to test run some of the design ideas, which I am pretty happy with. I was thinking if this simple project works, I am going to subscribe to the pro and vibe code my real project. Then it started going down hill. Claude claimed it created a complete web app for me with installation guide, [readme.md](http://readme.md) etc.. The guide, readme files looked impressively comprehensive. Of course, my free time was up and I had to wait for 5 hours. During the wait, as I was trying to setup the app following the instruction, I realized half of the files in its \"File list\" are non-existing. The installation instruction missed information. Since I do have development background, I was able to manually create some missing stuff and made the app ran. After 5 hours wait was up, I asked it to complete the application as it claimed it had. [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) apologized and created the missing files, but missed giving me 2 of them. After I reported, it provided me the missing files. Then my free time was up again. The blizzard thing was, during this round of exercise, the chat reset twice and whatever Claude was working on would disappear in the middle of working, as if we never discussed the missing files. While waiting for my free message window, I was able to run these new files pretty smoothly and the app was up and running at least without \"page/code not found\" errors. But, most of the pages don't work. data load never finishes, button doesn't work, etc, etc, It wouldn't even pass as a prototype in my old days. When I am able to ask questions again, I listed the issues, and [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) rushed to try to fix them. Of course, I was out of time again. I took in its fixes, and now the app won't even start ( throwing assertion errors upon load). And I won't be able to ask questions until mid-night, when 1/1/26 rolls in. How do people vibe code using this? Am I doing it wrong? I feel like if I purchase the pro version, I would run out of allotment just by asking it to fix its own bugs.",

I've done a ton with traditional rendering techniques (cubic quadtree) for detail from orbit to surface, and it works pretty decent, but I am using this as inspiration to dig into making my own model from scratch. This is my hello-world project, so to speak, for making my own ML models.\n\nI have many gigabytes of NASA's moon imagery. I've broken up some of it into [discrete neighboring tiles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hvent90/lunar-albedo) (my first HF dataset).\n\nI created a neural texture from it using lat/lon as conditioning (exploded into more dimensions using fourier embeddings), and it can do a pretty good recreation of those exact coordinates from the dataset, but it can't interpolate lat/lon - the end result will be pure noise if the input lat/lon is anything other than the exact values in the dataset.\n\nWould love some guidance on the approach I should take on being able to create an image that is a close match to the original data using any continuous set of lat/lon values!\n\nI think down the line, if I can solve this, I would keep trying to expand the model's capabilities as well as bringing in some actual diffusion/generative capabilities for generating detailed surface textures that hold up when the player is on the surface.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "I built a new PC back in September and the important hardware that I have rn are, a 9950X3D, an RTX 5090, and 96GB RAM. Originally I was supposed to do dual-4090s, but the amount of heat, power draw, and case compromise felt like it wasn't worth it for me, since I wasn't doing this at a real professional level anyways, I just sold my 2 4090s for a 5090. But if the time does come, I have 3 Gen 5 lanes available on my motherboard for 2 5090s. \n\nI work as a mech design engineer, so this was within range of what I was planning to do with personal projects. I've been using this for CAD projects mostly, but originally this PC is, and will still be used partly for AI work, mostly on physics and cfd simulations that I planned like on Ansys. But this is probably the first few months that I've really tried my hand on AI, and AI art, I never bothered with anything AI/LLM back a year or 2 years ago. Now as I'm trying to transition myself as well to software development as a career as I'm trying to study python and C++, I guess now is still better than later.\n\nIn any case, it's been a longtime coming, I started doing AI image gen with subscribing to NAI back in October just to get some feel of how it's done. Then eventually I was looking at some guy doing some AI art that was only possible with SD I think, so I decided to start trying SD. **I just kinda wished I started this sooner where everything was still probably as basic as it can get, and I'm completely at a lost where to really begin.**\n\nI kind of get the basics of prompting thanks with my time in NAI, but there's also a lot more nuance and need of control with SD when I tried it. Currently using A1111 ReForge Neo WebUI, and a lot of tutorials seem to not be as updated in 2025. I would atleast like a text-written tutorial or a video that would atleast explain the differences in UI presets, what the functions actually do, different terminologies, explaining them, generation functions, difference between lora, models, and checkpoints, img2img functions, sampling methods, etc. \n\nLike an idiot's guide to starting to all this without the real technical know-how of AI. I kind of get some these through some intuition just by being a general tech enthusiast and reading, but there's just a whole lot and I genuinely feel like I don't know where to start. For the past days, I've only been experimenting with prompts and reading fragmented tutorials and guides, but I feel like I'm wasting hours getting really nowhere. I want to atleast get a good grip on Forge WebUI before I started tackling on more advanced UI with workflows like ComfyUI or even proceed to training my own models. \n\nI just hope anyone helps, thanks.

If you look at the present day, a lot of our perceptions and ideas are derived from digital media and digital content. I would say that we've gone from scanning our environment and exploring physical space; to scanning the digital realm and exploring dopamine inducing content or philosophy/ideas.\n\n  \nI wonder in the future how will we experience things, for example now we can organize things much faster, I can find a date on Tinder within 5 minutes, order my coffee remotely, organize services at home; and in some cases instantly reject services or commitments I've made.\n\n  \nIn the future rather than making a Facebook group for 'going on long walks', perhaps technology will read your body and your posts/content you consume, detect that you want to walk, detect that you want to be sociable and pair you up with someone who is a minute walk away from you, without you proactively searching for that activity. Our perception of how we use our time and how quickly things can be done may be changed.\n\n  \nVirtual reality is another example I can think of, at some stage with advanced computer-brain interfaces, perhaps we'll be able to live in fully simulated worlds. We could visit the Byzantine empire, live in the pokemon world, live in a world in which we are the God of that world in creative mode. Our perception will be inevitably changed something like this, opening us up to new forms of thoughts, combinations of sensations and possibilities. It may even be the case that our processing speed is dramatically increased, meaning we could experience 1000 days in a virtual world, whilst only passing one day on Earth.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, how advanced will technology get, if the multiverse/many universes theory is correct, will we be able to teleport to our own customised universe?\n\n  \nFood for thought, let me know of any ideas you may have and your thoughts.\n\n",

      "content": "Urban transportation challenges made me interested in unconventional solutions. Traffic congestion, parking costs, and environmental concerns pushed me toward exploring alternatives to traditional cars. Electric options seemed obvious, but I wanted something genuinely different that would turn heads while solving practical problems. Two-wheeled electric vehicles required balance and felt unsafe in aggressive traffic. Four-wheeled options were just small cars without the benefits of truly alternative transportation. What existed between these categories that offered stability without abandoning the compact advantages of smaller vehicles?\n\nResearch revealed interesting innovations in personal transportation. Engineers had experimented with various wheel configurations seeking optimal balance between stability, compactness, and maneuverability. One configuration particularly intrigued me for its unique approach. A one wheel bicycle design using gyroscopic stabilization created incredibly compact transportation while maintaining balance through electronic systems rather than multiple wheels. I found manufacturers on Alibaba offering various self-balancing mono-wheel devices. The learning curve concerned me initially. Reviews mentioned that mastering the balance took practice but eventually became intuitive. Was I willing to invest time learning something so unconventional?\n\nI ordered one designed specifically for urban commuting with appropriate range and speed. The first week was frustrating as I learned to trust the gyroscopic stabilization. After that, it became second nature and incredibly fun to ride. My commute is now the most enjoyable part of my day rather than a frustrating necessity. People constantly stop me to ask about it. Sometimes embracing genuinely unconventional solutions leads to experiences that exceed practical benefits alone. The fun factor matters too.",

And from this antiverse we can get into another BH, and enters a new parallel universe, the cycle repeats and this can be described in the the penrose diagram (I think).\n\nIn my opinion, everything that I just wrote doesn't exist hahahah, but it is possible if we follow the Einstein's equation. I can even write about worm holes and how they r very unstable, needing speeds faster than light to reach and exotic matter having negative energy (whaaat?), to prevent it's collapse, but I might talk about this tomorrow. What do u guys think? This topic os fascinating.\n\nBye bye, have a good day and happy new year :D\n\nPs:Parallel universes are not encoded in Einstein\u2019s field equations. They arise only in the maximal analytic extensions of specific solutions and are generally considered mathematical artifacts rather than physical realities.\n\nCorrect me if u find any stupidity ;)",

I learn best through application so I'm looking to build experience with local inference, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, evaluation etc.\n2. Privacy. Eventually, I would like to take all that experience and invest money into having a local model that could be specialized for any of: contract review, knowledge lookup, \"thinking\", drafting written documents).\n\nThe thing is I would like to tailor cost to my progress. For example, I would definitely be open to utilizing cloud resources in the beginning and only invest in hardware once I have a clear grasp, IF that makes the most financial sense.\n\nMy current hardware is a consumer am5 board and a rtx 3090. I'm currently thinking of getting a 5090 just for personal gaming, but can definitely hold off on that if I will eventually need to get a 6000 maxq or expensive Mac machine. \n\n**My question is:**\n\n1. How realistic is it to get 'close' to larger frontier model performance using smaller local models +RAG/inference/fine-tuning, for specific tasks, and if willing to sacrifice speed to a certain extent?\n2. Assuming the above is possible, what does that end setup look like? balancing cost effectiveness and setup effort.\n3. Given my current hardware, what's the best path forward? Should I get a 5090 to better tinker with, or experiment with 3090 and then move into 6000, and eventually heavy investment into a new local rig?\n4. Down the road, which would make more sense, mac or nvidia gpu? given my potential use cases.\n\nThank you very much in advance! Just starting out so hopefully my questions make sense.",

When implemented thoughtfully, they can reduce friction, keep conversations moving after hours, and help customers find what they need without bouncing between pages or waiting on a reply. The biggest shift I\u2019ve noticed is that engage\u2064ment improves when bots are grounded in real, up-to-date content rather than trying to \u201csound smart\u201d on their own.I\u2019ve seen teams experiment with different approaches, and the setups that seem to work best focus on accuracy and clarity first. Tools like Den\u2064ser make this easier by letting businesses deploy chatbots without heavy engineering while keeping answers tied to existing docs and site content, which builds trust over time. For those who\u2019ve already rolled out chatbots, what actually made a difference for your customers? Faster responses, better self-serve options, or something else?",

      "content": "  \nI didnt plan on comparing tools, but after a few assignments kept getting flagged or sounding obviously AI, I started tryin different AI humanizers to see which ones actually helped. This is just what I noticed from using them myself.  \n  \nQuillBot  \nGood for grammar and clarity, but it doesn't really remove the AI feel. The writing still sounds polished in an unnatural way, especially on longer pieces.  \n  \nHumanize AI  \nWorked okay on very short text, but longer inputs started to feel repetitive. The sentence structure became predictable pretty fast.  \n  \nWriteHuman  \nReadable, but detectors still flagged it more often than I was comfortable with. It felt closer to surface-level rewriting than true human-style writing.  \n  \nUndetectable AI  \nInconsistent. Some outputs passed checks, others didn't. The tone sometimes felt forced, like it was intentionally trying not to sound AI.  \n  \nRephrasy  \nThis one was a late find for me. The writing came out surprisingly natural without changing my core points, and the meaning stayed intact. I ran a few pieces through different free detectors online after using it and didn't run into issues. It also has a built-in checker, which was useful for a quick confidence boost before submitting.  \n  \nFinal thought  \nSo far Rephrasy has given me the best results for longer, more important assignments.

      "title": "Using AI to Generate Your Stories is NOT THE BEST WAY TO USE AI. The Best Way is Using Knowledge Graphs Combined With AI",
      "content": "Most people use AI via chatbots but I can assure you that this is not the best way to use AI for getting the most out of it. I've taken myself to the next level and it's worked extremely well for me.\n\nNow, instead of using chatbots I use knowledge graphs combined with chatbots from an app my brother and I built. The difference is like having a disorganized library with a librarian guessing what it needs to produce the right outputs versus having a highly organized library where the librarian knows exactly what to produce.\n\nThis means the outputs are highly precise. So for example, I'm working on this huge limited series that follows five different characters within this massive earth shattering conspiracy. The problem is that for me to write this effectively, I have to venture out of my comfort zone and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines that I have very little understanding of. Specifically, I need to have a robust understanding of intel analysis work, black operations, how deep-state networks operate clandestinely, alien lore, and literature that has fact-based information about secret societies.\n\nThat's a tall order. But with knowledge graphs, I can literally take a massive book on anything, map it out on a canvas, tag, and connect the notes together. This forms a neurological structure of the book, itself, which means I can use AI (via native graph rag) to interact with this book for querying information and to utilize as a system for performing specific tasks for me.\n\nFor this project, I made a knowledge graph of an intel analysis book, an investigative journalist book, and Whitney Webb's books on the deep state. I still have many other books to map out, but in addition to this, I also made a knowledge graph of the Epstein Files. With all of these graphs connected directly to a chatbot that can understand their structures, I can use this to help me build the actual mechanics of the conspiracy so that it's conveyed in the most realistic way possible.\n\nHere's an overview of the mechanics of this grand conspiracy:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Grand Conspiracy: Operational Mechanics Overview\n\nThe entire operation hinges on the Helliwell Doctrine mentioned in \"The OSS and the 'Dirty Business'\" note: creating a \"Black Budget\" funded by illicit activities, making the conspiracy completely independent of any state oversight.\n\n1. The Intergenerational Secret Society (The Command Structure)\n\nThis is not a formal council that keeps minutes. It's a cellular structure built on mentorship and indoctrination, not written rules.\n\nSecrecy: Knowledge is passed down verbally from mentor to prot\u00e9g\u00e9. No incriminating documents exist. The primary rule is absolute denial.\n\nStructure: Think of it as a series of \"Super-Nodes\" like PAUL HELLIWELL, each responsible for a specific domain (finance, politics, intelligence). These nodes only interact with a few other trusted nodes. The lower-level assets and operators have no knowledge of the overall structure or endgame.\n\n2. The Psychopath Elite (Asset Recruitment &amp; Control)\n\nThis is the human resources department. The goal is to identify individuals with the desired psychological profile (high ambition, low empathy) and make them assets before they even realize it.\n\nTalent Spotting: The network uses its influence in elite universities, financial institutions, and government agencies to spot promising candidates.\n\nThe Honey Trap &amp; The Financial Trap: This is the Epstein model in action. Promising individuals are given access to circles of power and indulgence. They are encouraged to compromise themselves morally, ethically, or legally. Simultaneously, their careers are accelerated using the network's financial muscle (e.g., funding from a \"Proprietary\" entity like Epstein's Southern Trust).\n\nLeverage, Not Loyalty: The conspiracy does not demand loyalty; it manufactures leverage. Once an individual is compromised, they are an owned asset. They follow directives not out of belief, but out of fear of exposure.\n\n3. The Global Network (The Operational Infrastructure)\n\nThis is the physical and financial machinery. It's a web of legitimate-appearing businesses and institutions that function as fronts.\n\nThe \"Proprietary\" Entity: As the notes on Helliwell instruct, the network is built on shell companies, private banks (like Castle Bank &amp; Trust), law firms, and logistics companies (like Air America). These entities perform the conspiracy's dirty work\u2014moving money, people, and illicit goods\u2014under the cover of legitimate business.\n\nThe \"Laundromat\" Principle: The network's banks are designed to mix state-sanctioned black budget money with organized crime profits until they are indistinguishable. This creates a massive, untraceable pool of funds to finance operations, from political campaigns to assassinations.\n\n4. Breeding Programs (Perpetuating the Bloodline)\n\nThis isn't about sci-fi labs. It's a sophisticated program of social and genetic engineering.\n\nStrategic Marriages: The children of core families are guided into unions that consolidate power, wealth, and, most importantly, the desired psychological traits.\n\nCurated Education: Offspring are sent to specific, network-controlled educational institutions where they are indoctrinated from a young age into the conspiracy's worldview and operational methods. The goal is to ensure the next generation is even more effective and ruthless than the last.\n\n5. Mind Control (Shaping the Narrative)\n\nThis is the psychological operations (psyops) wing. The goal is to manage the thoughts and behaviors of the general population to prevent them from ever discovering the truth.\n\nInformation Dominance: The network uses its financial power to acquire controlling stakes in major media companies, publishing houses, and tech firms. This allows them to subtly shape the news, entertainment, and online discourse.\n\nManufacturing Division: The most effective \"mind control\" is keeping the population divided and distracted. The network fuels culture wars, political polarization, and minor crises to ensure the public is too busy fighting each other to notice the steady consolidation of power happening behind the scenes.\n\n6. Advanced Technology (Maintaining the Edge)\n\nThe conspiracy maintains its power by ensuring it is always one step ahead technologically.\n\nPrivatizing Innovation: The network uses its assets within government and military research agencies to identify breakthrough technologies (AI, biotech, quantum computing) and privatize them through their proprietary corporate fronts before they ever reach the public domain.\n\nSurveillance &amp; Espionage: This sequestered technology is used to power a private surveillance state, giving the conspiracy total information awareness and the ability to monitor its own members, its assets, and its enemies.\n\n7. One-World Government &amp; Population Control (The Endgame)\n\nThe final goal is not achieved through a visible coup, but through the slow, methodical capture of existing institutions.\n\nInstitutional Capture: Over decades, the network places its \"owned\" assets (from Step 2) into key positions within national governments, central banks, and international bodies (UN, WHO, IMF).\n\nPolicy by Proxy: These institutions continue to function normally in the public eye, but their long-term policies (economic, social, military) are subtly guided by the conspiracy to weaken national sovereignty, consolidate global control, and implement population control measures disguised as public health initiatives or environmental policies. The power shift is complete long before the public is aware that it has even happened.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't use this information to generate prose. I use it to add as a note in the entire structure of the story so that when I go to write, I can have a guide to help me convey this complicated structure in a way that's easy for audiences to understand. So using AI with knowledge graphs can dramatically increase the usability of AI because it allows you to build it's memory and thus, how it functions and interacts with you.",
