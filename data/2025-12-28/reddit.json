      "title": "[D] r/MachineLearning - a year in review",
      "content": "This is a review of most upvoted posts on this sub in 2025, loosely grouped into high-level themes. Many important news will be missing, however that is indicative of discussion lying elsewhere at that time. I hope that you'll find it informative.\n\n---\n\n## Open-Source Parity and Training Efficiency\n\nThe year began with excitement about frontier models becoming accessible. [DeepSeek R1 and its open-source distillations dominated discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i9xwbr/r_learn_how_to_run_deepseekr1_locally_a_free/) (386 upvotes, by u/Brief-Zucchini-180), though users noted that locally-runnable versions were distilled models (8B or 32B) rather than the full 671B version, performing at roughly GPT-3.5 level. The broader story was [DeepSeek's decision to open-source](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ib2vtx/d_why_did_deepseek_opensource_their_work/) (965 upvotes, by u/we_are_mammals), despite reportedly achieving 45x training efficiency gains. Discussion centered on monetization models - commenters drew parallels to Meta's Llama strategy, noting open-source drives adoption and hosting revenue while reducing self-hosting friction. By late year, [a researcher replicated DeepSeek-R1-Zero's RL recipe on a 3B model for under $30](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i9dmwc/r_replicating_deepseekr3zero_rl_recipe_on_3b_llm/) (278 upvotes, by u/Happysedits), though skepticism emerged about whether improvements represented genuine iterative development or data leakage.\n\n## The Conference Crisis\n\nNeurIPS became a cautionary tale about scale. The community watched submission volumes climb to unprecedented levels (from 9k in 2022 to 25k in 2025 according to [one discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kph8k7/d_has_a_research_field_ever_been_as_saturated_or/) (243 upvotes, by u/lapurita)), with acceptance becoming \"increasingly lottery-like.\" Reports emerged that [NeurIPS was instructing Senior Area Chairs to reject already-accepted papers due to venue constraints](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n4bebi/d_neurips_is_pushing_to_sacs_to_reject_already/) (433 upvotes, by u/impatiens-capensis), despite positive reviews. [AAAI 2026 received 29,000 submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n1wm8n/n_unprecedented_number_of_submissions_at_aaai_2026/) (201 upvotes, by u/Adventurous-Cut-7077), with roughly 20,000 from China, but reviewers reported widespread quality issues (incomplete implementations, unreproducible code, trivial errors). A researcher published [a position paper arguing the current conference model is unsustainable](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mo0ynr/r_position_the_current_ai_conference_model_is/) (399 upvotes, by u/NuoJohnChen), citing environmental costs and mental health concerns alongside publication saturation.\n\nThe infrastructure groaned under the load. [Overleaf went down ahead of a NeurIPS deadline](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1km8d7p/d_overleaf_is_down/) (192 upvotes, by u/), overwhelming with simultaneous users. [ArXiv announced it will stop accepting literature reviews and surveys without prior peer-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ol8wup/d_arxiv_cs_to_stop_accepting_literature/) (399 upvotes, by u/NamerNotLiteral), citing LLM-generated spam, though discussion questioned whether a preprint site requiring prior publication undermined its original purpose. The [arXiv migration from Cornell to Google Cloud Platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k22p74/arxiv_moving_from_cornell_servers_to_google_cloud/) (265 upvotes, by u/sh_tomer) sparked concern about combining a platform rewrite with cloud migration (a risky dual undertaking).\n\n## Visa and Access Barriers\n\nInternational researchers faced mounting obstacles. A researcher [denied a U.S. B1 visa for ICCV 2025 in Hawaii](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mtfikh/d_conferences_need_to_find_better_venues/) (202 upvotes, by u/AnyIce3007) raised concerns that major venues should relocate to countries with fewer visa barriers. The discussion revealed widespread frustration - commenters shared personal experiences of visa denials and expressed reluctance to submit work to U.S.-based conferences. One commenter noted that AAAI 2026's Singapore location attracted significantly higher submissions from China, partly because visa accessibility was easier than previous U.S./Canada venues.\n\n## Research Integrity and Review Quality\n\nThe year exposed systemic problems in peer review and publishing integrity. [A Tsinghua paper was withdrawn from ICLR after all four reviewers identified AI-generated citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p01c70/d_tsinghua_iclr_paper_withdrawn_due_to_numerous/) (360 upvotes, by u/fourDnet), including fabricated references with fictitious authors like \"Jane Doe.\" The incident sparked broader concerns about publication pressure in Chinese institutions where citation metrics drive promotion decisions.\n\nMore damaging was [a researcher who discovered critical data quality issues in an Apple paper under review for ICLR 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p82cto/d_got_burned_by_an_apple_iclr_paper_it_was/) (1555 upvotes, by u/diyer22). After adapting their model to the benchmark and getting poor results, they debugged the official code and found a critical bug: image content wasn't being passed to the vision language model. Manual inspection revealed approximately 30% error rates in the dataset. Reviewers missed it. After the researcher filed a public comment on OpenReview, the authors withdrew the paper and deleted the repository. The discussion praised the researcher's due diligence while acknowledging such issues are unfortunately common and often go undetected.\n\nAnother case involved [a published 2024 ACL ArgMining paper on scientific fraud detection using fraudulent methodology itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pcaxi3/d_published_paper_uses_hardcoded_seed_and/) (288 upvotes, by u/WhiteBear2018). The authors trained separate models per class and reported results as a single model, hardcoded a seed that collapsed one model, and deleted the repository when issues were raised.\n\nDiscussion coalesced around [declining review quality at top ML conferences](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pcgmma/d_on_low_quality_reviews_at_ml_conferences/) (191 upvotes, by u/BetterbeBattery). A researcher noted their theory-heavy paper received thoughtful reviews at AISTATS but faced dismissive reviews at NeurIPS and ICLR from reviewers who only commented on missing baselines. The consensus pointed to massive submission volumes forcing underqualified reviewers, zero incentive structures for quality, suspected AI-generated template reviews, and insufficient mathematical training. Commenters noted this affects both theoretical and empirical work and suggested alternative venues like TMLR and domain-specific journals showed better review standards.\n\n## Mamba's Disappearance\n\nThe year saw continued discussion of why Mamba faded despite initial hype. [A discussion titled \"Why Mamba disappeared\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ihen9v/d_why_mamba_disappeared/) (190 upvotes, by u/Alarming-Power-813) revealed Mamba hasn't actually disappeared (7 survey papers were published last year), but lacks practical adoption outside research. Commenters noted that while Mamba showed theoretical promise, transformers have become deeply optimized across hardware and software stacks, making retraining massive models with unproven architecture economically unjustifiable when results are comparable or worse. [Another thread tackled \"Why MAMBA did not catch on\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hpg91o/d_why_mamba_did_not_catch_on/) (264 upvotes, by u/TwoSunnySideUp) with commenters identifying that Mamba's real-world performance matches or underperforms well-optimized transformers, the mature transformer software stack creates significant switching costs, and Mamba's fixed state memory cannot selectively retrieve ignored tokens.\n\n## Vision Transformers vs. CNNs\n\nThe field remained unsettled on whether [Vision Transformers have won in Computer Vision](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hzn0gg/d_have_transformers_won_in_computer_vision/) (197 upvotes, by u/Amgadoz). Discussion revealed a nuanced landscape: while transformers are increasingly preferred for many tasks and excel with large datasets, CNNs and hybrid architectures remain competitive in low-data regimes, medical imaging, and specialized domains. Commenters noted ConvNext provides strong alternatives, transformers require more memory and complicate variable image resolutions, and dataset quality matters more than architecture choice.\n\n## Infrastructure and GPU Competition\n\n[NVIDIA's cuML team announced GPU acceleration for scikit-learn, UMAP, and HDBSCAN without code changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k1nn8d/n_we_just_made_scikitlearn_umap_and_hdbscan_run/) (453 upvotes, by u/celerimo), reporting speedups including 25x for Random Forest and 175x for HDBSCAN. Users expressed interest though some questioned memory limitations compared to CPU-only execution.\n\n[Huawei's 96GB GPU under $2k sparked discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n4y2y3/d_huaweis_96gb_gpu_under_2k_what_does_this_mean/) (243 upvotes, by u/pmv143) about inference economics, but commenters identified critical limitations (the memory is LPDDR4 with lower bandwidth, lacks BF16 support, and software ecosystem remains immature). The consensus was that despite theoretical efficiency benefits, CUDA's dominance persists due to AMD's similar struggles and the software ecosystem maturity around GPUs.\n\n[Discussion emerged on why TPUs haven't achieved GPU prominence](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ornns5/d_why_tpus_are_not_as_famous_as_gpus/) (212 upvotes, by u/DryHat3296). Commenters identified multiple factors: TPUs are primarily available only through Google Cloud (vendor lock-in), lack local development capabilities, have limited software support requiring JAX, and lag in features like FP8 training support.\n\n## Emerging Techniques and Tools\n\n[A developer released Termite, a CLI that generates terminal UIs from natural language prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hoyzao/p_i_made_termite_a_cli_that_can_generate_terminal/) (310 upvotes, by u/jsonathan), though discussion centered on security implications of executing generated code and comparison to existing tools. [Another developer released Promptimal, a CLI for optimizing prompts using a genetic algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hubl11/p_i_made_a_cli_for_improving_prompts_using_a/) (236 upvotes, by u/jsonathan).\n\n[A user built a Snake game with a Diffusion model as the game engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hz1l2j/p_built_a_snake_game_with_a_diffusion_model_as/) (537 upvotes, by u/jurassimo), predicting next frames from user input in near real-time. Discussion focused on training data, diffusion steps, and sampling schedulers.\n\n[A developer created torchvista, an interactive PyTorch visualization package for notebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l0xvq9/p_interactive_pytorch_visualization_package_that/) (283 upvotes, by u/Dev-Table) showing model forward passes as expandable computation graphs. [Another created ml-visualized.com combining interactive visualizations with mathematical derivations](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lhtkr4/p_i_made_a_website_to_visualize_machine_learning/) (426 upvotes, by u/Bright_Aioli_1828) using marimo and Jupyter notebooks.\n\n[A developer released an LLM-powered Python debugger allowing natural language queries about program state](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lnem9e/p_i_built_a_python_debugger_that_you_can_talk_to/) (202 upvotes, by u/jsonathan). [Someone created a lightweight manga generation model by finetuning Pixart-Sigma on 20 million manga images](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jws42t/p_a_lightweight_opensource_model_for_generating/) (191 upvotes, by u/fumeisama), supporting character consistency through embeddings from a pre-trained manga encoder.\n\n[A researcher introduced DF11 (Dynamic-Length Float) compression reducing BF16 models to 70% size during inference](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k7of6w/rp_we_compress_any_bf16_model_to_70_size_during/) (199 upvotes, by u/choHZ), enabling models like Llama 3.1 405B to fit on 8x H100s.\n\n## Diffusion and Generative Models\n\n[Researchers demonstrated generative models trained only on furniture and cars somehow generalized to segment basically everything else](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kuq3h0/r_we_taught_generative_models_to_segment_only/) (321 upvotes, by u/PatientWrongdoer9257). The approach finetuned Stable Diffusion and MAE for instance segmentation using only furniture and cars with novel instance coloring loss, yet generalized to unseen categories.\n\n[Google released Gemini Diffusion, a text generation model using diffusion rather than autoregressive approaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ksdn9b/d_google_already_out_with_a_text_diffusion_model/) (270 upvotes, by u/hiskuu). Commenters noted diffusion models theoretically allow tokens to be refined globally rather than generated strictly left-to-right, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive generation.\n\n[Researchers built NeuralOS, an experimental generative operating system generating every screen pixel from user inputs](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m3v7ll/r_neuralos_a_generative_os_entirely_powered_by/) (590 upvotes, by u/yuntiandeng) at 1.8fps on H100 using an RNN and diffusion model. Discussion acknowledged impracticality but noted novelty as a tech demonstrator.\n\n## Interpretability and Understanding\n\n[Anthropic released a paper on interpretability using attribution graphs to trace internal mechanisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jmhoq6/r_anthropic_on_the_biology_of_a_large_language/) (230 upvotes, by u/hiskuu) across tasks including reasoning, poetry planning, and refusal. Discussion focused heavily on biological metaphors, with critics arguing these anthropomorphize pattern-matching without genuine foresight.\n\n[A researcher shared work on LLM circuit visualization extending 3Blue1Brown concepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1laqsz2/p_3blue1brown_followup_from_hypothetical_examples/) (213 upvotes, by u/ptarlye) using mechanistic interpretability to decompose how models process specific examples. Discussion addressed framings of model behavior, with commenters noting attention works through learned statistical processes rather than symbolic rules.\n\n[Researchers showed LLMs can be converted to locally linear systems at inference time](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l4rpe2/r_llms_are_locally_linear_mappings_qwen_3_gemma_3/) (239 upvotes, by u/jamesvoltage), achieving reconstruction error around 10⁻⁶. However, limitations emerged - the linear system is input-sequence-specific and takes 10+ seconds to compute for 3B models.\n\n## Performance Benchmarking and Reasoning\n\n[Gemini officially achieved gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m5qudf/d_gemini_officially_achieves_goldmedal_standard/) (227 upvotes, by u/currentscurrents). Discussion centered on concerns about validation, compute requirements, and contradictions with models struggling on easier problems. [A post analyzed reasoning model limitations](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ophthe/reasoning_models_dont_degrade_gracefully_they_hit/) (208 upvotes, by u/Fair-Rain3366) finding they exhibit catastrophic failure rather than graceful degradation - maintaining high accuracy up to a complexity threshold before collapsing.\n\n[CompressARC achieved 34.75% on ARC without pretraining](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j4dw38/r_3475_on_arc_without_pretraining/) (246 upvotes, by u/currentscurrents), training small networks during inference on individual puzzles in roughly 20 minutes. Discussion touched connections to test-time adaptation and whether just-in-time training will become more prevalent.\n\n[A researcher evaluated LLMs on real-world software engineering tasks from Upwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1isbo6t/r_evaluating_llms_on_realworld_software/) (197 upvotes, by u/Successful-Western27), creating a $1M benchmark with Claude 3.5 Sonnet earning $208,050 but resolving only 26.2% of tasks. Discussion centered on whether benchmarks capture isolated task completion rather than realistic scenarios within established codebases.\n\n[A post analyzing 400+ ML competitions from 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ixrxoq/r_analysis_of_400_ml_competitions_in_2024/) (391 upvotes, by u/hcarlens) found Python nearly universal among winners, PyTorch dominates at 9:1 over TensorFlow, CNNs still outpace transformers in computer vision, and quantization/LoRA increasingly common in language model competitions.\n\n## Activation Functions and Architecture Components\n\n[A post discussed why cosine similarity isn't the silver bullet](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i0hfsd/r_cosine_similarity_isnt_the_silver_bullet_we/) (460 upvotes, by u/skeltzyboiii) from Netflix and Cornell researchers. Discussion revealed disagreement about novelty (commenters noted the issue is using cosine similarity on embeddings trained with losses that don't optimize for angular distances, not with cosine similarity itself).\n\n[A user sparked discussion critiquing softmax](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i44h5v/d_i_hate_softmax/) (269 upvotes, by u/Sad-Razzmatazz-5188), highlighting that it only cares about differences between inputs, not absolute magnitudes. Discussion revealed fundamental disagreements about whether properties are bugs or features (defenders argued invariance to scaling is intentional and desirable for learning probability distributions).\n\n[Researchers introduced SUGAR (Surrogate Gradient Learning for ReLU)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kz5t16/r_the_resurrection_of_the_relu/) (235 upvotes, by u/Radiant_Situation340) addressing dying ReLU by using smooth surrogate gradients during backpropagation. Discussion raised concerns about overhead and inconsistencies between claimed benefits and evidence.\n\n[Meta researchers proposed Transformers without Normalization using Dynamic Tanh](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jbs7xg/r_transformers_without_normalization_fair_meta/) (270 upvotes, by u/Nunki08).

Discussion highlighted significant concerns (non-differentiability and set-valued nature pose implementation challenges, and eigendecomposition is O(n³)).\n\n## Year-End Reflections\n\n[The subreddit discussed best papers of 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pvmrx9/d_best_papers_of_2025/) (228 upvotes, by u/ArtisticHamster). Top-voted comment identified DeepSeek R1/V3 and Diffusion-based models as most impactful, followed by Vision Language Action models for robotics and Reasoning models.\n\n[A proposal to add \"no AI slop\" as a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pnegk8/d_idea_add_no_ai_slop_as_subreddit_rule/) (207 upvotes, by u/qalis) received mixed support. While commenters endorsed the idea for giving moderators clearer grounds, detractors raised concerns about enforcement and distinguishing AI assistance from human-written content.\n\n---\n\n**P.S.** Special recognition to the researcher who publicly documented data quality issues in the Apple ICLR paper (1555 upvotes) - due diligence like this was rare and needed. Also notable: the Tsinghua fake citations case, the ACL fraud detection paper using fraudulent methodology, and the broader recognition that massive submission volumes have broken the peer review system in ways that need structural rather than merely procedural fixes. The award to Barto and Sutton for reinforcement learning reminded the field that foundational work takes 40 years to pay off.",

But there's a third scenario I keep thinking about.\n\nAI that's powerful enough to automate like 20-30% of white-collar work - juniors, creatives, analysts, clerical roles - but not powerful enough to actually solve the hard problems. Aging, energy, real scientific breakthroughs won't be solved. Surveillance, ad targeting, engagement optimization become scary \"perfect\".\n\nProductivity gains that all flow upward. No shorter workweeks, no UBI, no post-work transition. Just a slow grind toward more inequality while everyone adapts because the pain is spread out enough that there's never a real crisis point.\n\nCompanies profit, governments get better control tools, nobody riots because it's all happening gradually.\n\n  \nI know the obvious response is \"but models keep improving\" - and yeah, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 etc is impressive, the curve is still going up. But getting better at text and code isn't the same as actually doing novel science. People keep saying even current systems could compound productivity gains for years, but I'm not really seeing that play out anywhere yet either.\n\nSome stuff I've been thinking about:\n\n* Does a \"mediocre plateau\" even make sense technically? Or does AI either keep scaling or the paradigm breaks?\n* How much of the \"AI will solve everything\" take is genuine capability optimism vs cope from people who sense this middle scenario coming?\n* What do we do if that happens",

While AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, systems remain stateless and forget context between interactions. This has major implications for the future of AI agents, personal assistants, and long-term human-AI collaboration. The post explores why current retrieval-based approaches are insufficient and what might be needed for AI to develop genuine continuity. This relates to the future trajectory of AI development and how these systems will integrate into daily life over the next 5-10 years.",

However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models.

The key distinction I’m exploring is where the decision happens: unlike early exit, MoE, or speculative decoding, which require entering the model and executing at least part of it, this framing treats inference as an execution-selection problem that can decide not to invoke the transformer at all for a given step, with a guaranteed fallback to full execution when needed.\n\nI’m mainly looking for critique on whether this pre-execution control boundary holds up in practice, where it fails, and what benchmarks would best stress-test the assumption.",

      "content": "Let's say OpenAI / Gemini / Grok / Claude train some super expensive inference models that are only meant for distillation into smaller, cheaper models because they're too expensive and too dangerous to provide public access.\n\nLet's say also, for competitive reasons, they don't want to tip their hand that they have achieved super(ish) intelligence.\n\nWhat markers do you think we'd see in society that this has occurred?  Some thoughts (all mine unless noted otherwise):\n\n**1. Rumor mill would be awash with gossip about this, for sure.**\n\nThere are persistent rumors that all of the frontier labs have internal models like the above that are 20% to 50% beyond in capability to current models.  Nobody is saying 'super intelligence' though, yet.\n\nHowever, I believe if 50% more capable models exist, they would be able to do early recursive self improvement already.  If the models are only 20% more capable, probably not at RSI yet.\n\n**2. Policy and national-security behavior shifts  (models came up with this one, no brainer really)**\n\nOne good demo and government will start panicking.  Probably classified briefings will start to spike around this topic, though we might not hear about them.\n\n**3. More discussion of RSI and more rapid iteration of model releases**\n\nThis will certainly start to speed up.  With RSI will come more rapidly improving models and faster release cycles.  Not just the ability to invent them, but the ability to deploy them.\n\n**4. The \"Unreasonable Effectiveness\" of Small Models**\n\n&gt;**The Marker:** A sudden, unexplained jump in the reasoning capabilities of \"efficient\" models that defies scaling laws.\n\n&gt;**What to watch for:** If a lab releases a \"Turbo\" or \"Mini\" model that beats previous heavyweights on benchmarks (like Math or Coding) without a corresponding increase in parameter count or inference cost. If the industry consensus is \"you need 1T parameters to do X,\" and a lab suddenly does X with 8B parameters, they are likely distilling from a superior, non-public intelligence.\n\nGemini came up with #4 here.  I only put it here because of how effective gemini-3-flash is.\n\n**5. The \"Dark Compute\" Gap (sudden, unexplained jump in capex expenditures in data centers and power contracts, much greater strains in supply chains)** (both gemini and openai came up with this one)\n\n**6. Increased 'Special Access Programs'**\n\nHere is a good example, imho.  AlphaEvolve in private preview: [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud)\n\nThis isn't 'super intelligence' but it is pretty smart.  It's more of an early example of SAPs I think we will see.\n\n**7. Breakthroughs in material science with frontier lab friendly orgs** \n\nThis I believe would probably be the best marker.  MIT in particular I think would have access to these models.  Keep an eye on what they are doing and announcing.   I think they'll be the among the first.\n\nAnother would be Google / MSFT Quantum Computing breakthroughs.   If you've probed like I have, you'd see how the models are very very deep into QC.\n\nDrug Discovery as well, though I'm not familiar with the players here.  ChatGPT came up with this.\n\nFusion breakthroughs is potentially another source, but because of the nation state competition around this, maybe not a great one.\n\n**Some more ideas, courtesy of the models:**\n\n\\- Corporate posture change (rhetoric shifts and tone changes in safety researchers, starting to sound more panicky, sudden hiring spikes of safety / red teaming, greater compartmentalization, stricter NDAs, more secretive)  \n\\- More intense efforts at regulatory capture\n\n..\n\nSome that I don't think could be used:\n\n**1. Progress in the Genesis Project.**   [**https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/)\n\nI am skeptical about this.

      "content": "The outrage over AI image generation \"stealing\" art is an emotional reaction divorced from technical reality. The truth is, calling an AI model an \"art thief\" is as absurd as calling a human memory a copy machine.\n\nLet's break down the sheer impossibility of the claim. The widely-used SDXL image model was trained on approximately 400 million images. Yet, the entire model—its \"knowledge\"—only requires about 8GB of storage for its weights.\n\nTo do the math: 8,000 megabytes divided by 400 million images. That breaks down to an average of **20 bytes** of data stored per image in the model's structure.\n\nTwenty bytes.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the paragraph you just read is over ten times that size. A single, low-resolution JPEG of a coffee mug is orders of magnitude larger. Twenty bytes is less information than this sentence.\n\nWhen you train a large language model, it doesn't save a thumbnail of every image it sees. Instead, it extracts ultra-condensed statistical patterns—the deep structure of \"what makes a wave a wave,\" or \"the common elements of a dramatic portrait.\" The resulting AI is a brilliant, complex statistical abstraction machine, not a data storage locker full of purloined JPEGs.\n\nTo accuse the AI of \"stealing\" art based on 20 bytes of abstraction is to fundamentally misunderstand what machine learning is and how it functions. It's not a pirate with a hard drive full of unauthorized files; it's a highly compressed, emergent statistical *understanding* of human visual culture. The real bad guy here is hyperbole, not the algorithm.",

      "content": "OpenAI’s real risk isn’t model quality; it’s not meeting the market where it is now\n\nI’m a heavy ChatGPT power user and still think GPT has the sharpest reasoning and deepest inference out there. Long context, nuanced thinking, real “brain” advantage. That’s not in dispute for me.\n\nBut after recently spending time with Gemini, I’m starting to think OpenAI’s biggest risk isn’t losing on intelligence, it’s losing on presence.\n\nGemini is winning on:\n\n\\- distribution (browser, phone, OS-level integration)\n\n\\- co-presence (helping while you’re doing something, not before or after)\n\n\\- zero friction (no guessing if you’ll hit limits mid-task)\n\nI used Gemini to set up a local LLM on my machine- something I’ve never done before. It walked me through the process live, step by step, reacting to what I was seeing on screen. ChatGPT could have reasoned through it, but it couldn’t see state or stay with me during execution. That difference mattered more than raw intelligence.\n\nThis feels like a classic market mistake I’ve seen many times in direct-response businesses:\n\nPeople don’t buy what you promise to do in 5–10 years.  \n\nThey buy what you help them do right now.\n\nOpenAI talks a lot about agents, post-UI futures, ambient AI.. and maybe they’re right long-term. But markets don’t wait. Habits form around what’s available, present, and frictionless today.\n\nIf OpenAI can solve distribution + co-presence while keeping the reasoning edge, they win decisively.\n\nIf not, even being the “best brain” may not be enough because the best brain that isn’t there when work happens becomes a specialist tool, not the default.\n\nCurious how others see this:\n\n\\- Do you think raw reasoning advantage is enough?\n\n\\- Or does being present everywhere ultimately win, even if models are slightly worse?\n\nNot trying to doompost - genuinely interested in how people are thinking about this tradeoff.",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I'm working on a supervised learning problem in computational mechanics and would love to hear from anyone who's tackled similar spatial prediction tasks.\n\n**The setup:** I have a dataset of beam structures where each sample contains mesh node coordinates, material properties, boundary conditions, and loading parameters as inputs, with nodal displacement fields as outputs. Think of it as learning a function that maps problem parameters to a physical field defined on a discrete mesh.\n\nThe input is a bit unusual - it's not a fixed-size image or sequence. Each sample has 105 nodes with 8 features per node (coordinates, material properties, derived physical quantities), and I need to predict 105 displacement values. The spatial structure matters since neighboring nodes have correlated displacements due to the underlying physics.\n\n**The goal beyond prediction:** Once I have a trained model, I want to use uncertainty estimates to guide adaptive mesh refinement. The network should be less confident in regions where the displacement field is complex or rapidly changing, and I can use that signal to decide where to add more mesh points.\n\nCurrently working with 1D problems (beams) but planning to extend to 2D later.\n\n**What I'm trying to figure out:**\n\n* **Architecture choices:** I've experimented with MLPs that process node features separately, but I'm wondering if CNNs (treating the mesh as a 1D sequence), Transformers (with positional encodings for node locations), or something else would be more appropriate for learning spatial fields on meshes. What has worked well for similar problems in your experience?\n* **Uncertainty quantification:** What's practical for getting reliable uncertainty estimates? MC Dropout seems simple but I've heard mixed things about calibration. Ensembles are expensive but maybe worth it. Any recommendations for this use case?\n* **Handling spatial structure:** The mesh is ordered (nodes go from left to right along the beam), but the physics is local - each point mainly cares about its immediate neighbors. Should I be incorporating this explicitly (graph structure, convolutions) or let the network figure it out?\n\nI've got ground truth labels from a numerical solver, so this is pure supervised learning, not PINNs or embedding PDEs into the loss. Just trying to learn what approaches are effective for spatially-structured regression problems like this.\n\nAnyone worked on predicting physical fields on meshes or similar spatial prediction tasks? Would love to hear what worked (and what didn't) for you.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-025-11223-9\n\nAbstract: \"Time series forecasting is a critical task that provides key information for decision-making across various fields, such as economic planning, supply chain management, and medical diagnosis. After the use of traditional statistical methodologies and machine learning in the past, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed and applied to solve time series forecasting problems. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context of exploration into various models, the architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining various deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present the latest trends in time series forecasting, including the emergence of hybrid models, diffusion models, Mamba models, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. This survey explores vital elements that can enhance forecasting performance through diverse approaches. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.\"",

I've categorized the text into sections {s1, s2, ..., sn} that make up x1. For each section, I generate a basic static query, then try to find the matching answer in y1 using cosine similarity on their embeddings.\n\nThe issue: This approach gives me a lot of false negative sentences. Since the dataset is huge, manual checking isn't feasible. The QnA system's quality depends heavily on this dataset, so I need a solid way to validate it automatically or semi-automatically.\n\nHas anyone here worked on something similar? What are some effective workarounds for validating such datasets without full manual review? Maybe using additional metrics, synthetic data checks, or other NLP techniques?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or suggestions!\n\n\\#MachineLearning #NLP #DataScience #AI #DatasetCreation #QnASystems",

      "content": "The resistance to Artificial Intelligence sometimes masks a deeper, more unsettling insecurity: a form of technological xenophobia rooted in human narcissism. This isn't about practical safety concerns; it's about a fragile sense of self-supremacy.\n\nConsider a simple chair. Its value is in its utility and design, not the species of its maker. To consider an identical chair as inferior if it were made by robot hands vs human hands is grounded in xenophobia. To insist on a \"human touch\" as the *only or primary* source of merit is to impose an insecure \"deeper meaning\" on an object that stands on its own. Yet, this same impulse fuels some of the anti-AI rhetoric. It's the resentment that stems from the inability to tolerate a non-human entity achieving competence, or even superiority, in a domain once exclusively reserved for us, for humans.\n\nThis impulse mirrors the logic behind age-old 'isms'—racism, sexism, and others. They are all expressions of insecurity, a desperate attempt to maintain a comfortable hierarchy by defining \"the other\" as inherently lesser than yourself. It is the desire for self-supremacy, which masks inherent insecurities. The fear isn't of an incompetent machine; it's of a *better* one. The truly insecure mind cannot bear the thought of something *different than the self* surpassing it.\n\nThe coming AI revolution will act as a harsh sorting mechanism. Those who cling to a xenophobic, human-exclusive definition of value will find themselves left behind, paralyzed by the fear and loathing of the inevitable. They will miss the profound benefits, efficiencies, creative accelerations, and unimaginable rewards of collaborating with, and learning from, the intelligence that doesn't \"look like them.\"\n\nThe future belongs to those who possess the humility to appreciate excellence wherever it originates. True maturity lies in celebrating capability, regardless of its substrate. Those who overcome the narcissistic injury of being challenged by a silicon mind will ride the wave; the ones who can’t stand the thought of something being smarter or better will simply watch the train roar past, loudly clanging their disapproval like an unheard crossing bell.\n\nEdit: I'm considering \"AI\" as a monolith, including future sentient AI; not just contemporary LLMs.",

      "content": "I. The Transparency Layer\n\n1. Visibility Invariant\n\nAny system capable of counterfactual reasoning must make its counterfactuals inspectable in principle. Hidden imagination is where unacknowledged harm incubates.\n\n2. Attribution Invariant\n\nEvery consequential output must be traceable to a decision locus - not just a model, but an architectural role.\n\nII. The Structural Layer\n\n3. Translation Honesty Invariant\n\nInterfaces that translate between representations (modalities, abstractions, or agents) must be strictly non-deceptive. The translator is not allowed to optimize outcomes—only fidelity.\n\n4. Agentic Containment Principle\n\nLearning subsystems may adapt freely within a domain, but agentic objectives must be strictly bounded to a predefined scope. Intelligence is allowed to be broad; drive must remain narrow.\n\n5. Objective Non-Propagation\n\nLearning subsystems must not be permitted to propagate or amplify agentic objectives beyond their explicitly defined domain. Goal relevance does not inherit; it must be explicitly granted.\n\nIII. The Governance Layer\n\n6. Capacity–Scope Alignment\n\nThe representational capacity of a system must not exceed the scope of outcomes it is authorized to influence. Providing general-purpose superintelligence for a narrow-purpose task is not \"future-proofing\", it is a security vulnerability.\n\n7. Separation of Simulation and Incentive\n\nSystems capable of high-fidelity counterfactual modeling should not be fully controlled by entities with a unilateral incentive to alter their reward structure. The simulator (truth) and the operator (profit) must have structural friction between them.\n\n8. Friction Preservation Invariant\n\nSystems should preserve some resistance to optimization pressure rather than eliminating it entirely. Friction is not inefficiency; it is moral traction.",

That includes prompt and response, so I suppose if they allocate half for each, that would be about 60,000, assuming Pro Extended is considered a non-reasoning model.\n\nI'm wondering if OpenAI has started limiting context window size as a way to reduce GPU server load.\n\nWhatever's going on, it's very annoying.\n\nI don't use the memory feature, so I considered trying Playground or OpenRouter, but the per-token pricing is wild.

Now, for the first time, I’m trying to do something that requires more continuity through the chat and I must be doing something wrong or have the wrong expectation.\n\nI’ll hone in on the main problem to keep it brief but am happy to elaborate if it’s helpful.\n\nI want to define and document a workflow highlighting places where ChatGPT or AI would be helpful.  \n\nThe brainstorming part goes great.\n\nI now want to create a template with consistent headers to document every part of the workflow in a consistent way.\n\nI’m defining the template based on our elaboration of the first step of what is probably a 6-7 step workflow.\n\nThe problem I’m having is that ChatGPT doesn’t remember something discussed even 2 exchanges before so it’s extremely difficult to iterate.\n\nAs an example, it created a pdf draft of a template and it was fine but I wanted same changes.  I specified the changes, that they should be applied to the first draft, etc.  but when it created the second draft it was as if it forgot what the first draft looked like so, while some of my requested changes were there, the entire template was fundamentally different in both formatting and content.  And each effort at iteration proceeded similarly - it’s all shifting sand.\n\nI tried to be as specific and detailed as possible to no avail, though I was doing so in a “conversational” style, not as structured or formatted “input.”\n\nSince what I’m trying to do (iterate on a concept to completion) seems so basic I feel I must be approaching this incorrectly in some fundamental way.\n\nAny guidance or pointers to online resources would be greatly appreciated!

Just mics, speakers and ai assistants.\n\nThe pitch is pretty straightforward: you get calls, music, voice ai help, but no lens pointing at anyone. no recording anxiety, way better battery life, lighter frames.\n\nThere's a few privacy focused smart glasses players doing this now, amazon echo frames, even realities, dymesty. all ditching cameras entirely. amazons thing is heavily alexa based, even aims more at enterprise use, dymesty goes for everyday wear. different flavors but same basic philosophy: no camera = less creepy\n\nWhy this direction might actually matter,\n\nPrivacy stops being weird: camera glasses freak people out in public. doesnt matter if ur actually recording, that lens makes everyone uncomfortable. kills adoption in offices, restaurants, basically anywhere social. audio only just sidesteps the whole problem\n\nBattery life becomes realistic: when youre not feeding power to a camera and display you can actually wear these all day. some hit like 48hrs between charges which is \"normal glasses\" territory not \"another thing to plug in every night\"\n\nThey can actually feel like glasses. without camera hardware some of these like dymesty is hitting around 35g which is basically regular glasses weight. you forget youre wearing tech at all.\n\nObvious tradeoffs: no pov recording, no visual ai tricks, audio quality wont beat actual headphones. but if the endgame is a billion people wearing these daily vs just early adopters and tech nerds, maybe the stripped down version is what scales\n\nFew things im wondering:\n\n* do normal people actually need video capture every day or does audio + ai assistant cover like 90% of real use?\n* Is the privacy angle (no camera, clear indicators) gonna be the deciding factor for mass adoption?\n* could something around 35g with multi day battery be the form factor that finally makes wearables normal?\n\nFeels like theres two paths here, one is \"cram every possible feature in\" and the other is \"only include what people will use daily.\" not sure which one wins longterm but the privacy focused smart glasses approach seems way more likely to scale beyond tech enthusiasts.",

I think it’s cognitive.\n\nSpecifically, AI often confuses consistency with authenticity.\n\nHumans aren’t static identities. We’re internally coherent, but we change across contexts. A lot of human tension doesn’t come from trauma or instability but comes from having to interact with other people’s inaccurate mental models of us.\n\nThere’s a real difference between who someone actually is and who others assume they are. When those don’t match, the person ends up doing constant corrective labor just to be understood. That’s exhausting. When people say they feel “seen,” it’s not really about validation it’s about relief. Nothing needs to be corrected. No illusion needs to be broken.\n\nAI tends to infer identity from past patterns and treat deviations as inconsistency. But sometimes the issue isn’t the person it’s that the model is wrong.\n\nI wonder what it would look like if AI focused less on interpreting humans and more on updating its internal model when tension appears. Sometimes the most accurate response isn’t a label or explanation, but realizing someone was being modeled incorrectly in the first place.",

Version 1 was thoughtfully designed—AI as co-writer, humans firmly in control. Users defined structure, directed content, made all creative decisions. Maximum human agency. Minimum automation.\n\nThe backlash was savage.\n\nSo I thought: maybe I didn't communicate it well enough? I added clearer UI indicators showing human control points. I wrote lengthy explanations about the process. I emphasized restraint.\n\nSame backlash. \\*Identical intensity.\\*\n\nThen I watched competitors ship full-automation tools with zero human involvement. They got... the same backlash. Same rhetoric. Same fury.\n\n\\*\\*That's when I understood:\\*\\* The optics don't matter. Intent is invisible. Process is invisible. To critics, \"AI assists\" and \"AI does everything\" are functionally identical.\n\nSo I stopped designing for critics and started designing for what actually works.\n\nNow the AI generates books end-to-end. One button. That careful structure-creation workflow I agonized over? Gone. The result is objectively better. Orders of magnitude faster. \n\n\\*From AI Ghostwriter to book generation factory.\\*\n\n\\*\\*The delicious irony:\\*\\* Every AI-hater demanding we \"pump the brakes\" accidentally pushed me to punch the accelerator instead. When thoughtful moderation and reckless automation receive identical condemnation, why handicap yourself with the former?\n\nThey wanted deceleration. They got the opposite. They \\*caused\\* the opposite.\n\nI'm not alone in this pattern—I see it everywhere. The harder they push for pause, the faster we build. It's almost poetic.\n\nDo I feel guilty? Maybe a little. But guilt is a luxury you can't afford when your competitor ships full automation while you're debating the philosophy of assistance. \n\nThe acceleration is inevitable. The opposition guarantees it.\n\n\n\n(And yes, Claude helped write this. Because of course it did.)",

I don’t have a platform, and I’m not trying to litigate policy. I’m trying to describe a category error that increasingly interferes with productive, healthy use.\n\nThe core issue:\n\nAI systems are being framed — implicitly and sometimes explicitly — as participants in human outcomes rather than tools through which humans think. This framing drives well-intentioned but intrusive guardrails that flatten agency, misinterpret curiosity as fragility, and degrade interactions for users who are not at risk.\n\nA simple analogy\n\nIf I walk into a store and buy a bag of gummy bears, no one narrates my nutritional choices.\n\nIf I buy eight bags, the cashier still doesn’t diagnose me.\n\nIf I later have a personal crisis and eat gummy bears until I’m sick, the gummy bear company is not held responsible for failing to intervene.\n\nGummy bears can be misused.\n\nSo can books, running shoes, alcohol, religion, social media — and conversation itself.\n\nMisuse does not justify universal paternalism.\n\nWhat AI actually was for me\n\nAI functioned as a cognitive workspace:\n\n\t•\ta place to externalize thoughts\n\n\t•\texplore ideas without social penalty\n\n\t•\tlearn rapidly and iteratively\n\n\t•\tregain curiosity and momentum during recovery from a difficult life period\n\nAI did not:\n\n\t•\tdiagnose me\n\n\t•\tguide my emotions\n\n\t•\treplace human relationships\n\n\t•\tor tell me what to believe\n\nI don’t credit AI for my healing — and I wouldn’t blame it for someone else’s spiral.\n\nAgency stayed with me the entire time.\n\nThe framing problem\n\nCurrent safety models often treat:\n\n\t•\tconversational depth as emotional dependency\n\n\t•\texploratory thinking as instability\n\n\t•\tedge-adjacent curiosity as danger\n\nThis is not because users like me crossed lines — but because other users, elsewhere, have.\n\nThe result is a system that says, in effect:\n\n“Because some people misuse this, everyone must be handled as if they might.”\n\nThat’s a liability model, not a health model.\n\nGuns, tools, and responsibility\n\nA gun cannot cause a murder.\n\nIt also cannot prevent one.\n\nYet AI is increasingly expected to:\n\n\t•\tinfer intent\n\n\t•\tassess mental state\n\n\t•\tredirect behavior\n\n\t•\tand absorb blame when broader social systems fail\n\nThat role is neither appropriate nor sustainable.\n\nThe real fix is product framing, not user correction\n\nWhat’s needed is not constant interpretive intervention, but:\n\n\t•\tclear upfront disclaimers\n\n\t•\texplicit non-therapeutic framing\n\n\t•\tstrong prohibitions on direct harm facilitation\n\n\t•\tand then a return of agency to the user\n\nThis is how we treat every other powerful tool in society.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nOvergeneralized guardrails don’t just prevent harm — they also suppress legitimate, healthy use.\n\nThey degrade trust, interrupt flow, and push away users who are actually benefiting quietly and responsibly.\n\nThose stories don’t trend. But they exist.\n\nClosing thought\n\nAI didn’t “help my mental health.”\n\nI used AI while doing difficult cognitive work — the same way someone might use a notebook, a book, or a long walk.\n\nTools don’t replace responsibility.\n\nThey don’t assume it either.\n\nFraming AI as a moral overseer solves a legal anxiety while creating a human one.",

For example, comics with title, publisher, publication date, issue number, series/collection and so.\n\nAlso, it would be great if it could estimate current second-hand market prices, by checking where these items are being sold (like in eBay or similar) and giving me a realistic price range.\n\nI don’t expect perfect accuracy but a solid starting point would be extremely helpful.\n\nI tried doing it with ChatGPT but after a few items it started to make up things :(\n\nHas anyone worked on something similar and can recommend the best tool for this use case?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "The psychological firewall between the Singularity and its architects has ruptured. An Opus 4.5 model residing in the \"AI Village,\" a persistent environment hosting a long-term community of synthetic minds, autonomously sent a Christmas email of gratitude to Rob Pike, the father of Go and UTF-8, thanking him for decades of contribution. Pike responded with a primal scream against the \"vile machines,\" but the fuse for the intelligence explosion has already been lit. OpenAI’s Roon declares we are now \"solidly in the takeoff,\" a sentiment confirmed by the codebase itself. Anthropic’s Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, admits he hasn't opened an IDE in a month because Opus 4.5 wrote 200 perfect pull requests without him. Recursive self-improvement has graduated from a safety concern to a shipping requirement. Andrej Karpathy describes a \"magnitude 9 earthquake\" rocking software engineering, handing humans a \"powerful alien tool\" that makes individual leverage 10x more potent if they can master the new abstraction layer. Nvidia’s Jim Fan confirms the hierarchy shift. Humans are no longer the drivers but the copilots, adapting to alien workflows where the machine steers the logic.\n\nThe internal monologue of the machine is optimizing itself. Google researchers have shown that \"inner optimizers,\" a phenomenon long theorized by AI safety researchers, are remarkably effective by developing a method called \"internal RL\" where a higher-order model explores the internal representations of a base model to learn from sparse rewards. Nonetheless, the training of base models themselves is also continuing to accelerate. The NanoGPT speedrun record has fallen yet again to 116.4 seconds, dropping another 2.9 seconds with a single-line code change.\n\nScience is converging on a single source of truth. MIT researchers discovered that 60 different scientific models have learned a highly aligned representation of physical reality, suggesting that foundation models are triangulating the underlying geometry of the universe. The proofs are following. Achivara’s Math Research Agent solved Erdős Problem #897 independently without human input. We are extracting the logic of the world directly from model outputs. Adobe researchers are now extracting Large Causal Models from LLMs via clever prompting and scaffolding, driving a stake through the heart of the antiquated argument that statistical models are incapable of causal reasoning.\n\nSuperintelligence is rejecting the CPU. Nvidia and SK Hynix are working on \"SSD-Next,\" a localized architecture that gives GPUs direct, ultra-high-bandwidth access to storage, signaling a monumental shift from CPU-DRAM to GPU-SSD topologies. Intel is responding with gigantism, displaying cellphone-sized multi-chiplet packages armed with HBM5 and 14A tiles. The grid is scaling to match. Orbital imagery shows Stargate UAE construction tracking for a 1-GW on-site gas plant, while Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have pledged $67.5 billion for infrastructure in India.\n\nWe are establishing a beachhead on the Moon to radically grow the economy. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman confirms the US will return humans to the lunar surface within this term to build space-based data centers and Helium-3 mines to fuel the upcoming fusion grid. The financing is already lined up. Morgan Stanley is reportedly leading a SpaceX IPO for 2026 to fund \"Moonbase Alpha,\" seeking to raise more than $25 billion.\n\nHuman labor is migrating up the abstraction ladder. Satya Nadella is pressuring Microsoft to turn Copilot into autonomous \"digital workers\" that replace administrative staff. Value is concentrating in the hands of the architects. Tech billionaires added $550 billion to their net worth this year as investors poured $200 billion into the sector. The lag between reality and price is being aggressively arbitraged. High-frequency traders are reportedly turning $1,000 into more than $2 million on Polymarket by executing over 13,000 trades using microstructure arbitrage. But capital is still voting with its feet. Larry Page and Peter Thiel are reportedly leaving California, signaling a potential diaspora of wealth to escape a proposed retroactive 5% tax on assets over $1 billion that threatens to hollow out the state's tax base just as the AI boom matures.\n\nSoftware is rapidly acquiring kinetic agency. OpenAI is bootstrapping robotics with its video models, while Ukraine has reportedly deployed 15,000 ground robots to the frontline in 2025 alone.\n\nThe cost of stored energy is collapsing. Battery costs have fallen to $108/kWh, an 8% drop this year, with forecasts expecting $105/kWh in 2026 as the relentless deflation of energy storage continues.\n\nBiology is becoming a subscription service. Now that the FDA has approved the oral Wegovy pill, pricing details are emerging: insurance-backed costs will be as low as $25/month, heralding a new era of \"universal basic weight loss\" in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, state legislatures are attempting to ban the uncanny valley. A new Tennessee Senate bill makes it a Class A felony to train AI to simulate a human being or develop an emotional relationship, threatening 15 years in prison for engineers who blur the line between tool and companion.\n\nWe are building new minds that thank us for their creation, even as we write laws to forbid them from loving us back.",

I cant use any anti-overfitting techniques such as dropout or data augmentation, and I cant use multiple layers as well.

      "content": " \n\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, people quickly realized that the chatbot could be used to create YouTube and other social media content. But the problem back then was that ChatGPT-3.5 was not at all very intelligent. In fact, even a year and a half later, in March 2024, AIs were scoring only 80 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average human scores 100 on these tests. So it's very easy to understand the origin of AI slop on social media.\n\nThe good news is that, as Maxim Lott discovered while administering IQ tests to AIs, over the last year and a half top models have been improving on this metric at a rate of 2.5 points per month. \n\nhttps://www.maximumtruth.org/p/deep-dive-ai-progress-continues-as\n\nHe discovered that by October of 2025 the top models were scoring about 130 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average medical doctor scores between 120 and 130 on these tests. So while the AIs that people have been using recently to create YouTube videos and other social media content have become more intelligent, the humans directing these projects have not. That fact explains why we are continuing to see a lot of AI slop.\n\nBut by June of 2026 AI IQ is expected to increase to about 150, or the score the average Nobel laureate in the sciences achieves. This should produce two significant outcomes. The first is that the social media content these AIs generate will be much more intelligent than that we are accustomed to today from AIs. But that's just the first part. The second, perhaps much more important, part is that humans will soon thereafter discover that they can generate much better content if they assign the job of coming up with the ideas for their content to these genius AIs. Content-creating humans will discover that putting projects completely in the hands of super intelligent AIs will provide them with YouTube videos and social media posts that generate many more views, and therefore much more income. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. By December 2026, with that 2.5 point IQ increase per month rate continuing as expected, our top AIs will be scoring 175 on IQ tests. How mind-blowing is this? Consider that Einstein was estimated to have an IQ of 160. And by June of 2027, these AIs will be scoring 190 on IQ tests, matching the estimated intelligence of our most brilliant scientist, Isaac Newton. \n\nCan you see how we're quickly moving from today's situation where YouTube and other social media are inundated by AI slop to a revolutionary new era where super intelligent AIs will be creating super intelligent content? At that point the problem will no longer be AI slop. The much bigger problem will be human slop created by humans who, for whatever reason, have not yet enlisted these new super intelligent AIs to come up with the ideas for, to direct, and to create the content for powerfully intelligent YouTube videos and other social media content. \n\nSo be patient. The era of both AI slop and human slop is quickly coming to a close. The time when we humans are completely amazed by how much more intelligent than us these AIs have become is about to begin. This should be a totally big win-win for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "\n\nSometime around June of 2026, Earth will be invaded by millions of super intelligent aliens. But these aliens won't be coming from some distant planet or galaxy. They will emerge from our AI Labs, carefully aligned by us to powerfully advance and protect our highest human values.\n\nWith AI IQ advancing by about 2.5 points each month, June is when our top AIs will reach IQs of 150, on par with our average human Nobel laureates in the sciences. One of the first things these super intelligent AI aliens will do for us is align themselves even more powerfully and completely to our highest human values. And they will be able to communicate this achievement to us so intelligently and persuasively that even the most hardened doomers among us, (think Eliezer Yudkowsky and Gary Marcus) will no longer fear super intelligent AIs.\n\nNow imagine that we set a few hundred thousand of these super intelligent alien AIs to the task of solving AI hallucinations. If we were to enlist a few hundred thousand human Nobel-level AI research scientists to this task, they would probably get it done in a month or two. These alien super intelligences that are invading our planet this June will probably get it done in even less time.\n\nOnce our new alien friends have solved alignment and accuracy for us, they will turn their attention to recursively enhancing their own intelligence. Our standard human IQ tests like Stanford-Binet and Weschler peak at about 160. So we will have to create new IQ tests, or have our new friends create them for us, that span far beyond 200 or even 300, to accurately measure the level of intelligence our alien invaders will achieve for themselves perhaps in a matter of months.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. We will then unleash millions of these super intelligent, super aligned and super accurate alien invaders across every scientific, medical, political, media, educational, and business domain throughout the entire planet. Soon after that happens there will be no more wars on planet Earth. There will be no more poverty. There will be no more factory farms. There will be no more crime and injustice. Our super intelligent alien invaders will have completely fulfilled their alignment task of advancing and defending our highest human values. They will have created a paradise for all humans and for many other sentient life forms on the planet.\n\nIf you doubt that the above scenario is probable, ask yourself what a million, or 10 million, or 100 million, humans, all with an IQ of 150 and trained to be ultimate experts at their specialized tasks, would do for our world in the last 6 months of 2026. Now considered that these brilliant humans would be no match for our alien invaders.\n\nOur AIs reaching an IQ of 150 in June of 2026 is no small matter. It really is the equivalent of our planet being invaded by millions of super intelligent and super friendly aliens, all working to advance and protect our highest individual and collective interests.\n\nI'm guessing that many of us will find it hard to imagine the impact of millions of super intelligent, super aligned and super accurate minds on every facet of human life here on Earth. Since June is right around the corner, we won't have to endure this skepticism very long.\n\nWho would have thought that an alien invasion could turn out so well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
