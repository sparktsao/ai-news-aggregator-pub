      "content": "When I created Claude Code as a side project back in September 2024, I had no idea it would grow to be what it is today. It is humbling to see how Claude Code has become a core dev tool for so many engineers, how enthusiastic the community is, and how people are using it for all sorts of things from coding, to devops, to research, to non-technical use cases. This technology is alien and magical, and it makes it so much easier for people to build and create. Increasingly, code is no longer the bottleneck.\n\nA year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.\n\nFast forward to today. In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs -- 497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed. Every single line was written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5. Claude consistently runs for minutes, hours, and days at a time (using Stop hooks). Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history. And we're still just getting started..",

This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.\n \nWe have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.  These questions are hard and there is little precedent; a lot of ideas that sound good have some real edge cases. \n \nIf you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying.\n \nThis will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.\n\nhttps://t.co/bnFRnDE4O7",

      "content": "Very good question\n\nGrok estimates \ud83c\udf4c Nano Banana Pro cost Google about $50-$200 million just to train\n\nEvery year the models get better (and bigger), and generally require more compute (like others have said), so the next better model will cost a multiple of that, so like $500 million or even $1 billion\n\nSo unless I'd raise $500 million to train that next model I don't think it's possible, because I simply do not have $500 million lying around\n\nAnother thing is that it's starting to become clear being in the model business is generally a very bad idea for most people because the moment a better model arrives, everyone just changes their code:\n\nfrom:\n> 'model'=>'current-model'\nto:\n> 'model'=>'the-new-model'\n\nAs in, the switching cost is almost $0, so models do not have much lock in\n\nWhich is WHY I think you'll see the best models come out of BigTech, because they can afford to spend massive money on creating the best models, and then make that money back by using those models in their entire portfolio of apps (see Google)\n\nI don't think long term as a AI model startup you can keep up with that, because they 1) can't raise enough money for the trainings to compete with BigTech's infinite pockets, 2) can't survive the moment a better model comes around, 3) they don't have the front end and users to get a moat\n\nWhat that means for my AI apps though is that it might be better I don't have my own models because I don't face the financial risk of training a model that's outdated in 6 months, and I just keep updating to whatever new model comes out (yes like a wrapper)\n\nBeing a niche AI app like my app Photo AI is, I can actually offer features that make it better than a general AI experience you'd have on ChatGPT or Gemini so it can remain a long-term business that way by specializing on a specific area of people photography",

      "content": "I've consulted for 100+ companies over the last 3 years, and here are some of my personal favorite recommendations:\n\n(You'd be shocked at how many developers outside the online bubble need help.)\n\n1. Some teams don't use any code versioning system. I know this is hard to believe, but I have witnesses. Honestly, this one is not common, but I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\n2. Testing culture is rare. An easy way to improve what a team does is to teach them how to write automated unit and integration tests.\n\n3. Spreadsheets are the most popular solution I've seen in the wild. For example, one of my most common recommendations is to use MLFlow to track experiments and version models.\n\n4. Most teams always want to implement the technically correct solution for a problem. I've gotten very good at identifying solutions that meet many more constraints (like budget, timeline, team ability, perception, etc.) I call this \"problem framing\", and it's of huge help for companies.\n\n5. I always recommend dev containers to those teams where each person uses a different operating system and struggles with configuration and portability.\n\n6. Try to scale an application without spending time on observability and traceability. Most of the time, this is as easy as logging the right information. Sometimes you can spend time setting up the right tools for more serious observability.\n\n7. In machine learning systems (90% of the projects I deal with), monitoring is always an afterthought. I've gotten pretty good at helping teams integrate with Evidently AI.\n\n8. I spend a ton of time helping teams build end-to-end, repeatable, and automatable workflows with fill-in-the-blank placeholders they can complete later on. For example, building a training pipeline that starts with data processing and ends with model deployment.\n\nMany different practices always come up with different teams:\n\n\u2022 How to implement CI/CD\n\u2022 How to version datasets\n\u2022 How to know what \"done\" means\n\u2022 How to manage secrets properly\n\u2022 How to manage configuration settings\n\u2022 How to configure logs\n\u2022 How to test in production (a/b testing, shadow deployments, etc)\n\u2022 ...\n\nPeople working for big tech companies are years ahead of everyone else, but the market for this knowledge outside big tech is huge.",

      "content": "@realVeshnu @arian_ghashghai To understand the answers to that, you have to look at how we failed in the drone market. In that sector, the Chinese were simply able to build things better and cheaper. There are several reasons for that:\n\n1. The retail infrastructure in Shenzhen:\n   They have a massive, multi-story electronics store where you can find any part needed to build anything. This means you can go in during the morning and have a prototype finished by the afternoon. In contrast, we have to wait two or three days for Amazon to deliver everything in America.\n\n2. Manufacturing density:\n   If you need to produce something, there are a thousand factories in Shenzhen or the surrounding area. That isn't true in America. Here, we might have a single Tesla factory in San Francisco, but there are very few facilities that can scale up to manufacture robots by the millions.\n\n3. The university system and research talent:\n   If you look at my AI community list on X (which consists of AI researchers), you'll notice a significant number of Chinese names. They have stepped up their innovation and education game while we haven't.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to the ability to manufacture things at scale at a much lower price point than we can in America. I keep hearing that same sentiment over and over again from the robotics community in San Francisco.\n\nOne last thing to consider is consumer demand. China has 10 cities bigger than New York. People live in very small houses and are crammed together in skyscrapers, which isn't true in most places in America. \n\nThis environment creates a much hungrier appetite for new ideas and innovation in China. That massive internal market lets companies get started and quickly reach scale\u2014companies like Insta360, among others.",

      "content": "We've all finished a chapter only to realize we can't remember what we just read. This points to something decades of research has confirmed: passive reading is surprisingly ineffective for learning.\n\n# The control effect\n\nMarkant et al. (2014) stripped away different aspects of self-directed learning to find what actually matters. They have found that even just pressing a button when ready to see the next item\u2014with no control over content or duration\u2014significantly enhanced recognition memory.\n\nThe researchers suggested this works because controlling when you see new information lets you coordinate stimulus presentation with your own attentional state. When you decide when to advance, your brain is better prepared to encode what comes next.\n\n# Self-pacing and strategy\n\nTullis and Benjamin (2011) showed that self-paced learners outperformed those who studied for the same total time but couldn't control their pace. The benefit was strongest for learners who spent more time on difficult material\u2014a \"discrepancy reduction\" strategy. Self-pacing isn't just about having control; it's about using it to allocate attention where it's needed.\n\n# Why agency matters\n\nDuBrow et al. (2019) found that choice are inherently rewarding. Items learned when participants could make a choice (even an inconsequential one) were remembered better, and there was a correlation between how much someone's preference increased for chosen items and how much their memory improved. Agency engages value-based brain systems that strengthen consolidation.\n\nDing et al. (2021) extended this to incidental memory\u2014showing that even when participants weren't trying to memorize, having control over the task improved later recognition, particularly for items processed quickly.\n\n# ChapterPal\n\nI programmed @ChapterPal to implement these principles: gradual text reveal controlled by the reader, AI-generated comprehension quizzes inserted during reading, regular guess-this-blurred-term puzzles, and contextual Q&A for engaging with difficult passages. \n\nThe quizzes and puzzles align with research showing that testing and guessing strengthens retention, while the self-paced reveal directly implements the minimal agency sufficient to enhance memory.\n\n# References\n\n- Tullis & Benjamin (2011).

No astronomer alive has ever believed it to be a flat, static disk.\n\nThe first hypotheses of vertical oscillations in the Galactic disk emerged from early theoretical models by astronomers like Oort (1932), using the \"slab\" model, leading to later work by Mathur (1990), Weinberg (1991), and others.\n\nThe new research presents clear observational evidence for this very natural gravitational dynamics behavior. That\u2019s great and very important. But it isn\u2019t like a surprising unexpected discovery. It\u2019s called experimental scientific research.\n\nhttps://t.co/e4NAQj6Qhk",
