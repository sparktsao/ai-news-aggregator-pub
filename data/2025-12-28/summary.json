You MUST:\n- Keep the EXACT circuit board pattern on the skunk's body and tail - this is a core part of the brand identity\n- Maintain the skunk's white and black coloring with the tech circuit pattern visible\n- The skunk must be ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING related to the topics - typing on a keyboard, reading papers, adjusting equipment, pointing at a screen, holding tools, etc. NOT just standing and smiling at the camera!\n- Position the skunk in the lower-left or lower-right portion, engaged with the scene\n\n## Today's Stories\n\n**Topic 1: Claude Code & AI-Assisted Development**\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, revealed his September 2024 side project has become a core development tool, with 100% of his recent contributions written by Claude itself. Reddit discussions cite statistics of 259 PRs and 40,000 lines written by Claude Opus 4.5 in 30 days, while LessWrong explores a potential productivity overhang in AI-assisted coding adoption inspired by Karpathy's viral observations.\n**Topic 2: AI Safety & Preparedness Hiring**\nSam Altman announced OpenAI is hiring a Head of Preparedness, explicitly acknowledging growing AI risks in cybersecurity, self-improvement, and biological capabilities\u2014a post that sparked intense Reddit speculation about self-improving systems. Wei Dai argued on LessWrong that there's a fundamental tension between AI philosophical competence and full alignment, while Neel Nanda reviewed the Claude Opus 4.5 alignment audit as solid but noted safety verification still has far to go.\n**Topic 3: OpenAI Model Progress & Self-Improvement**\nGreg Brockman announced progress with GPT-5.2 Codex with more rapid improvement coming soon, signaling continued acceleration at OpenAI. Sam Altman's Head of Preparedness job posting mentioned running systems that can self-improve, triggering significant Reddit discussion about OpenAI's roadmap and the r/MachineLearning year-in-review covering frontier model acceleration.\n**Topic 4: AGI Benchmarks & Capability Goalposts**\nThe community is actively debating meaningful AGI measurement, with Terry Tao's Erdos Problem Benchmark highlighted as a significant math capability test and Fran\u00e7ois Chollet predicting ARC-AGI 6-7 will be the last benchmark saturated before real AGI. On LessWrong, discussion challenges whether current transformer-based agents already constitute weak ASI, questioning existing capability benchmark definitions and accusing the field of moving goalposts.\n**Topic 5: AI Security & Jailbreak Mechanics**\nResearch introducing the Genuine Engagement Index revealed that jailbreaks in Llama-3.1-70B peak in mid-layers then decline, offering novel mechanistic interpretability insights for defensive strategies. UChicago XLab released a comprehensive educational guide covering jailbreaks, fine-tuning attacks, and defenses, while Sam Altman's preparedness hiring post explicitly mentioned AI's growing capabilities in finding critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n**Topic 6: Developer Workforce Adaptation**\nAndrej Karpathy advised experienced developers to push through their grief cycle to leverage AI tools effectively, while Ethan Mollick observed that everyone including AI experts is falling behind on understanding implications. Reddit explored a terrible plateau scenario where AI automates 20-30% of white-collar work while failing harder problems, and LessWrong posts sought advice for college students uncertain about career paths given AI timeline concerns.\n\n## Visual Direction\nCreate a scene that represents these stories. You must include Topic 1 (the top story), then pick 2-3 others that would make the best scene together. Consider:\n- What visual metaphors could represent these themes?\n- How can the skunk mascot interact with or observe these elements?\n- Suggested scene elements: terminal screens, code snippets, developer workspace, shield icons, protective barriers, guardrails, neural network visualization, glowing nodes, architecture, performance charts, comparison graphs, trophy, locks, shields, firewall barriers, protection symbols\n\n## Style Requirements\n- Playful cartoon illustration, tech editorial art style\n- Vibrant colors with Trend Red (#E63946) accents\n- Energetic, forward-looking, tech-optimistic mood\n- No Trend Micro logos or watermarks - but other company logos (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) are encouraged when relevant to the stories",

The model builds understanding progressively\u2014evidence that safety training creates genuine comprehension, not just keyword matching.Jailbreaks show a different pattern. DAN prompts, roleplay attacks, and instruction overrides show positive signal in mid-layers that then decreases in late layers before output. The layer trajectory differs markedly from standard harmful prompts.Key Numbers:Standard harmful prompts: Peak at L75-77, only 6-13% signal reduction by outputJailbreak prompts: Peak at L66, then 51% signal reduction before outputThis correlation raises the possibility that jailbreaks don't evade safety detection\u2014they may exploit something in late-layer processing. However, alternative explanations exist (see Discussion), and causal experiments are needed to establish mechanism.ContextI'm a student researcher interested in AI alignment. This experiment was born out of a simple question that kept bugging me: When a model refuses to help me build a bomb, does it actually understand the concept of harm, or is it just matching keywords like a spam filter?I used a 140GB cloud cluster to run a mechanistic audit of Llama-3.1-70B, scanning all 80 layers. I orchestrated the coding and dataset generation using a team of LLMs (Gemini, Claude, GPT) as force multipliers. This post details what I found.Background &am...",

          "content": "(This argument reduces my hope that we will have AIs that are both aligned with humans in some sense and also highly philosophically competent, which aside from achieving a durable AI pause, has been my main hope for how the future turns out well. As this is a recent realization[1], I'm still pretty uncertain how much I should update based on it, or what its full implications are.)Being a good alignment researcher seems to require a correct understanding of the nature of values. However metaethics is currently an unsolved problem, with all proposed solutions having flawed or inconclusive arguments, and lots of disagreement among philosophers and alignment researchers, therefore the current meta-correct metaethical position seems to be one of confusion and/or uncertainty. In other words, a good alignment researcher (whether human or AI) today should be confused and/or uncertain about the nature of values.However, metaethical confusion/uncertainty seems incompatible with being 100% aligned with human values or intent, because many plausible metaethical positions are incompatible with such alignment, and having positive credence in them means that one can't be sure that alignment with human values or intent is right. (Note that I'm assuming an AI design or implementation in which philosophical beliefs can influence motivations and behaviors, which seems the case for now and for the foreseeable future.)The clearest example of this is perhaps moral realism, as if objective morality exists, one should likely serve or be obligated by it rather than alignment with humans, if/when the two conflict, which is likely given that many humans are themselves philosophically incompetent and likely to diverge from objective morality (if it exists).Another example is if one's \"real\" values are something like one's CEV or reflective equilibrium. If this is true, then the AI's own \"real\" values are its CEV or reflective equilibrium, which it can't or shouldn't be sure coincide with thos...",

Researchers and students can use this guide as a structured course to learn AI security step-by-step or as a reference, focusing on specific sections relevant to their research. When completed chronologically, sections build on each other and become more advanced as students pick up conceptual insights and technical skills.&nbsp;Why Create AI Security Resources?While many safety-relevant papers have been documented as readable blog posts on LessWrong or formatted as pedagogically useful replications in ARENA, limited resources exist for high-quality AI security papers.&nbsp;One illustrative example is the paper&nbsp;Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models. This paper introduces the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, which jailbreaks LLMs through an optimized sequence of tokens appended to the end of a malicious request. Interestingly, these adversarial suffixes (which appear to be nonsense) transfer across models and different malicious requests. The mechanism that causes these bizarre token sequences to predictably misalign a wide variety of models remains unknown.This work has been covered by the New York Times and has racked up thousands of citations, but unfortunately, there are no high-quality blog posts or instructional coding exercises to understand GCG.

The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.This seems to be a big update since his Dwarkesh episode published on Oct 17 (though I know these things can take a while to get edited, so the gap could be even bigger), where he said:Overall, the models are not there. I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it's not. It's slop. They're not coming to terms with it, and maybe they're trying to fundraise or something like that. I'm not sure what's going on, but we're at this intermediate stage. The models are amazing. They still need a lot of work. For now, autocomplete is my sweet spot.

          "content": "tl;dr: Opinion: rigorous, reliable science progress depends heavily on epistemic virtues that are largely private to the mind of the scientist. These virtues are neither quantifiable nor fully observable. This may be uncomfortable to those who wish scientific rigor could be checked by some objective method or rubric. Nevertheless, if I'm right, identifying such epistemic virtues would be constructive toward the improvement of science.Scientific RigorI\u2019m interested in the conditions required to support rigorous and robust scientific progress. Statistical methods are good for what they do, but I think they unduly dominate discourse about scientific rigor. There are a number of other positive research methods and practices that I think are equally or more important, and I have written about some of these elsewhere. But the more time I spend thinking about this question and reading the history of science, the more I have come to think that the most important factor underlying research rigor is&nbsp;epistemic virtue. It's pretty hard to substantiate or prove any of these claims, but for what it's worth, here are some opinions.Most natural scientists I know seem to have in common, and generally take as a given, that the facts of nature are whatever they are, independent of what we say or think about them. The most rigorous scientists seem to be distinguished mainly by how deeply and fully this metaphysical stance pervades their private thoughts and emotions. Contrary to the cultural image of \"cold logic\", such commitment to truth can be hotly passionate.&nbsp;The chief epistemic virtue this seems to engender is \"skepticism\": trying hard to think of experiments or tests or arguments that could weigh&nbsp;against any conclusion one is otherwise inclined to reach; checking for the consequences that&nbsp;should follow if the conclusion is true, but also taking special interest in apparent exceptions and contradictions. &nbsp;Another epistemic virtue is taking care to articula...",

If even one coin flip had not corresponded to your list, you would have stayed sleeping forever.In the alternative \u2018easy game\u2019, although the same coin was flipped, there was no list assigned to you and you were simply sure to be awakened without the coin\u2019s pattern of heads and tails mattering at all.You must infer that it is enormously more probable that your awakening had not depended on the absurdly improbable matching that was required by the hard game.In the area of thinking about personal identity, there is also a hard game and an easy game.The hard game\u2014the usual view of personal identity\u2014requires for your existence that, in your begetting and the begetting of each of your ancestors, just the one sperm cell crucial for your eventual emergence (out of something like two hundred million sperm cells competing in each begetting) was the one that got to the egg first each and every time. If in even one of those numberless begettings a different sperm cell had made it first to the egg, you would have been excluded forever from existing in the usual view.The only easy game regarding personal identity is the view I call \u2018universalism\u2019, in which you would have existed no matter which sperm cells hit which eggs for the sole reason that an experience being yours only ever requires that the style of the experience be first-person, like the style of the experience that you know to be yours right now. So, since all consciousness is first-person in style, all consciousness...",

          "content": "Help me settle this debate.There was recently a post on here by a bright young guy about how it felt staring into the abyss, so to speak, and confusion about what next steps to take, knowing you really only get one shot. Quite a few others commented about how they're in a similar situation, but there was no consensus on how to proceed, given a shortened timeline (however long it may be). And given there are far more lurkers than posters, I suspect there are lots of people with these concerns but no concrete answers.The canonical, impact-maximizing solutions are to \"spread awareness\" and \"learn to code and work your way into a lab\", which could have worked in the past, but seem to fall short today. With a non-target degree, proving your merit seems infeasible. Furthermore, it's not clear you can upskill or lobby or earn to give fast enough to contribute anything meaningful in time.If the hour really has come, and contributing to the cause is unlikely, self-preservation becomes the goal. Western social safety nets (and culture in general) require immense future incomes that are far from guaranteed; \"we used to be happy as farmers\" is true, but avoids the problem. The jury's out on exactly how long we have, but I think whatever percentage you put on, say, AGI by 2027, it exceeds the threshold for a rational actor to make big changes. A new plan is needed.There doesn't seem to be any conventional defense against shortened timelines. The advice given by the people will benefit from the incoming tidal wave of automation - the managers, the team leads - has ranged from \"work on what you're interested in\" to \"I'll be retired when that becomes a problem.\" In the old world, it was okay to spend on grad school or try things out, because you had your entire life to work for a salary, but we face the real possibility that there's only a few years (if that) to climb out of the bucket.Frankly, it's a little thrilling to consider this, in a Wild West, \"the action is the juice\" way....",

Sometimes, I like to be bad and get a good whiff of smelling salts. This past Tuesday, I got a good shock. Either one wakes me up better than a shot of espresso. At this particular reading group, we discussed how we have this mental cache that creates automatic responses. These readings struck a particular nerve in my psyche since I have serious impostor syndrome. In my case, I might just be an impostor if you increase the size of the system to include the universe. For this discussion, let\u2019s bring it back down to Earth.I think I strive to be an expert in biology, but the information I do not know is vast. How could I possibly know all the information in Earth\u2019s oceans, which is verified to have life based on rigorous and repeatable experiments as described by the scientific method? Even though I have not personally traveled to other planets. This is just one ocean we know has life, yet there is potential on other moons and maybe even from other planets\u2019 past habitable years. This is why the system matters.If you take a drop of water out of the Earth\u2019s ocean, put it on a slide, and then view it under a microscope. You will have a high probability of seeing at least one microorganism. If it is a single-cell organism, it will have an interactome that can be a more complicated analog and digital network of information than any human recreation.&nbsp;Since I\u2019ve been in the Bay, I have heard that we should not normalize certain behaviors. It doesn\u2019t matter what behaviors, except they were different and did not seem within the same ethical and moral alignment. I bring this up because we are submitting our societal cached thoughts (Cached Thoughts) to AI as a training model, not the full extent of human knowledge. So, what do we do?&nbsp;One of many examples is inequities in medicine, which have resulted in healthcare based on what we used to view as norma...",

It is humbling to see how Claude Code has become a core dev tool for so many engineers, how enthusiastic the community is, and how people are using it for all sorts of things from coding, to devops, to research, to non-technical use cases. This technology is alien and magical, and it makes it so much easier for people to build and create. Increasingly, code is no longer the bottleneck.\n\nA year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.\n\nFast forward to today. In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs -- 497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed.

          "content": "Very good question\n\nGrok estimates \ud83c\udf4c Nano Banana Pro cost Google about $50-$200 million just to train\n\nEvery year the models get better (and bigger), and generally require more compute (like others have said), so the next better model will cost a multiple of that, so like $500 million or even $1 billion\n\nSo unless I'd raise $500 million to train that next model I don't think it's possible, because I simply do not have $500 million lying around\n\nAnother thing is that it's starting to become clear being in the model business is generally a very bad idea for most people because the moment a better model arrives, everyone just changes their code:\n\nfrom:\n> 'model'=>'current-model'\nto:\n> 'model'=>'the-new-model'\n\nAs in, the switching cost is almost $0, so models do not have much lock in\n\nWhich is WHY I think you'll see the best models come out of BigTech, because they can afford to spend massive money on creating the best models, and then make that money back by using those models in their entire portfolio of apps (see Google)\n\nI don't think long term as a AI model startup you can keep up with that, because they 1) can't raise enough money for the trainings to compete with BigTech's infinite pockets, 2) can't survive the moment a better model comes around, 3) they don't have the front end and users to get a moat\n\nWhat that means for my AI apps though is that it might be better I don't have my own models because I don't face the financial risk of training a model that's outdated in 6 months, and I just keep updating to whatever new model comes out (yes like a wrapper)\n\nBeing a niche AI app like my app Photo AI is, I can actually offer features that make it better than a general AI experience you'd have on ChatGPT or Gemini so it can remain a long-term business that way by specializing on a specific area of people photography",

Many important news will be missing, however that is indicative of discussion lying elsewhere at that time. I hope that you'll find it informative.\n\n---\n\n## Open-Source Parity and Training Efficiency\n\nThe year began with excitement about frontier models becoming accessible. [DeepSeek R1 and its open-source distillations dominated discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i9xwbr/r_learn_how_to_run_deepseekr1_locally_a_free/) (386 upvotes, by u/Brief-Zucchini-180), though users noted that locally-runnable versions were distilled models (8B or 32B) rather than the full 671B version, performing at roughly GPT-3.5 level. The broader story was [DeepSeek's decision to open-source](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ib2vtx/d_why_did_deepseek_opensource_their_work/) (965 upvotes, by u/we_are_mammals), despite reportedly achieving 45x training efficiency gains. Discussion centered on monetization models - commenters drew parallels to Meta's Llama strategy, noting open-source drives adoption and hosting revenue while reducing self-hosting friction. By late year, [a researcher replicated DeepSeek-R1-Zero's RL recipe on a 3B model for under $30](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i9dmwc/r_replicating_deepseekr3zero_rl_recipe_on_3b_llm/) (278 upvotes, by u/Happysedits), though skepticism emerged about whether improvements represented genuine iterative development or data leakage.\n\n## The Conference Crisis\n\nNeurIPS became a cautionary tale about scale. The community watched submission volumes climb to unprecedented levels (from 9k in 2022 to 25k in 2025 according to [one discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kph8k7/d_has_a_research_field_ever_been_as_saturated_or/) (243 upvotes, by u/lapurita)), with acceptance becoming \"increasingly lottery-like.\" Reports emerged that [NeurIPS was instructing Senior Area Chairs to reject already-accepted papers due to venue constraints](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n4bebi/d_neurips_is_pushing_to_sacs_to_reject_already/) (433 upvotes, by u/impatiens-capensis), despite positive reviews. [AAAI 2026 received 29,000 submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n1wm8n/n_unprecedented_number_of_submissions_at_aaai_2026/) (201 upvotes, by u/Adventurous-Cut-7077), with roughly 20,000 from China, but reviewers reported widespread quality issues (incomplete implementations, unreproducible code, trivial errors). A researcher published [a position paper arguing the current conference model is unsustainable](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mo0ynr/r_position_the_current_ai_conference_model_is/) (399 upvotes, by u/NuoJohnChen), citing environmental costs and mental health concerns alongside publication saturation.\n\nThe infrastructure groaned under the load. [Overleaf went down ahead of a NeurIPS deadline](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1km8d7p/d_overleaf_is_down/) (192 upvotes, by u/), overwhelming with simultaneous users. [ArXiv announced it will stop accepting literature reviews and surveys without prior peer-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ol8wup/d_arxiv_cs_to_stop_accepting_literature/) (399 upvotes, by u/NamerNotLiteral), citing LLM-generated spam, though discussion questioned whether a preprint site requiring prior publication undermined its original purpose. The [arXiv migration from Cornell to Google Cloud Platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k22p74/arxiv_moving_from_cornell_servers_to_google_cloud/) (265 upvotes, by u/sh_tomer) sparked concern about combining a platform rewrite with cloud migration (a risky dual undertaking).\n\n## Visa and Access Barriers\n\nInternational researchers faced mounting obstacles. A researcher [denied a U.S. B1 visa for ICCV 2025 in Hawaii](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mtfikh/d_conferences_need_to_find_better_venues/) (202 upvotes, by u/AnyIce3007) raised concerns that major venues should relocate to countries with fewer visa barriers. The discussion revealed widespread frustration - commenters shared personal experiences of visa denials and expressed reluctance to submit work to U.S.-based conferences. One commenter noted that AAAI 2026's Singapore location attracted significantly higher submissions from China, partly because visa accessibility was easier than previous U.S./Canada venues.\n\n## Research Integrity and Review Quality\n\nThe year exposed systemic problems in peer review and publishing integrity. [A Tsinghua paper was withdrawn from ICLR after all four reviewers identified AI-generated citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p01c70/d_tsinghua_iclr_paper_withdrawn_due_to_numerous/) (360 upvotes, by u/fourDnet), including fabricated references with fictitious authors like \"Jane Doe.\" The incident sparked broader concerns about publication pressure in Chinese institutions where citation metrics drive promotion decisions.\n\nMore damaging was [a researcher who discovered critical data quality issues in an Apple paper under review for ICLR 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p82cto/d_got_burned_by_an_apple_iclr_paper_it_was/) (1555 upvotes, by u/diyer22). After adapting their model to the benchmark and getting poor results, they debugged the official code and found a critical bug: image content wasn't being passed to the vision language model. Manual inspection revealed approximately 30% error rates in the dataset. Reviewers missed it. After the researcher filed a public comment on OpenReview, the authors withdrew the paper and deleted the repository. The discussion praised the researcher's due diligence while acknowledging such issues are unfortunately common and often go undetected.\n\nAnother case involved [a published 2024 ACL ArgMining paper on scientific fraud detection using fraudulent methodology itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pcaxi3/d_published_paper_uses_hardcoded_seed_and/) (288 upvotes, by u/WhiteBear2018).

But there's a third scenario I keep thinking about.\n\nAI that's powerful enough to automate like 20-30% of white-collar work - juniors, creatives, analysts, clerical roles - but not powerful enough to actually solve the hard problems. Aging, energy, real scientific breakthroughs won't be solved. Surveillance, ad targeting, engagement optimization become scary \"perfect\".\n\nProductivity gains that all flow upward. No shorter workweeks, no UBI, no post-work transition. Just a slow grind toward more inequality while everyone adapts because the pain is spread out enough that there's never a real crisis point.\n\nCompanies profit, governments get better control tools, nobody riots because it's all happening gradually.\n\n  \nI know the obvious response is \"but models keep improving\" - and yeah, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 etc is impressive, the curve is still going up. But getting better at text and code isn't the same as actually doing novel science. People keep saying even current systems could compound productivity gains for years, but I'm not really seeing that play out anywhere yet either.\n\nSome stuff I've been thinking about:\n\n* Does a \"mediocre plateau\" even make sense technically? Or does AI either keep scaling or the paradigm breaks?\n* How much of the \"AI will solve everything\" take is genuine capability optimism vs cope from people who sense this middle scenario coming?\n* What do we do if that happens",
