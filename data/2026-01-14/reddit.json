Lots of PCIe risers, I didn’t know about MCIO 8 months ago. The board has 7× x16 Gen4 slots, so for the 8th GPU I’m using an x8/x8 bifurcator plus a daisy-chained riser: motherboard to riser to bifurcator to GPU 1 on the bifurcator and GPU 2 on another riser. This is purely because of physical space and riser length limits.</p>\n<p>As expected, things are weird. One GPU runs at x8, the other at x4, likely the daisy-chained riser but I haven’t had time to deep-debug. Another GPU shows up as x8 even when it shouldn’t, either a jumper I’m missing or a 3090 with a mining or modded vBIOS. Stability only became acceptable after forcing all PCIe slots to Gen3 Although I still see...</p>"
