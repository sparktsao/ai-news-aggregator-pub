It looked at all PRs to the repo and categorized and prioritized them, made commits against some of them etc. I'm still very much in the loop. It made subtle mistakes that I had to point out. It got confused a few times and (amusingly) admitted that what it said was a \"brain fart\" (verbatim quote hah). It has missed a few ideas that I had to pitch. It made a bunch of bad design decisions that bloat the code and coupled abstractions that I had to revert. It's not perfect but I'm used to doing all of these things manually, so just seeing it running on the side cranking away at larger scope problems and coordinating all these flows in relatively coherent ways is definitely a new experience and a complete change of workflow.",

      "content": "Everyone's freaking out about vibe coding. In the holiday spirit, allow me to share my anxiety on the wild west of robotics. 3 lessons I learned in 2025.\n\n1. Hardware is ahead of software, but hardware reliability severely limits software iteration speed. \n\nWe've seen exquisite engineering arts like Optimus, e-Atlas, Figure, Neo, G1, etc. Our best AI has not squeezed all the juice out of these frontier hardware. The body is more capable than what the brain can command. Yet babysitting these robots demands an entire operation team. Unlike humans, robots don't heal from bruises. Overheating, broken motors, bizarre firmware issues haunt us daily. Mistakes are irreversible and unforgiving.\n\nMy patience was the only thing that scaled. \n\n2. Benchmarking is still an epic disaster in robotics. \n\nLLM normies thought MMLU & SWE-Bench are common sense. Hold your \ud83c\udf7a for robotics. No one agrees on anything: hardware platform, task definition, scoring rubrics, simulator, or real world setups. Everyone is SOTA, by definition, on the benchmark they define on the fly for each news announcement. Everyone cherry-picks the nicest looking demo out of 100 retries.\n\nWe gotta do better as a field in 2026 and stop treating reproducibility and scientific discipline as second-class citizens.\n\n3. VLM-based VLA feels wrong. \n\nVLA stands for \"vision-language-action\" model and has been the dominant approach for robot brains. Recipe is simple: take a pretrained VLM checkpoint and graft an action module on top. But if you think about it, VLMs are hyper-optimized to hill-climb benchmarks like visual question answering. This implies two problems: (1) most parameters in VLMs are for language & knowledge, not for physics; (2) visual encoders are actively tuned to *discard* low-level details, because Q&A only requires high-level understanding. But minute details matter a lot for dexterity.\n\nThere's no reason for VLA's performance to scale as VLM parameters scale. Pretraining is misaligned. Video world model seems to be a much better pretraining objective for robot policy. I'm betting big on it.",

      "content": "NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper Awards\n\nThe paper addresses the following question: why don't diffusion models simply memorize their training data, given that they have enough parameters to do so?\n\nThe authors discover that the answer lies in a separation of timescales during training\u2014models learn to generate quality samples at time \u03c4_gen, but only begin memorizing at a later time \u03c4_mem that grows linearly with dataset size.\n\nThis means larger datasets don't just provide more variety; they fundamentally change the training dynamics by pushing memorization further into the future, opening a widening window where early stopping yields generalization.\n\nThe paper backs this up both empirically and theoretically.\n\nA must-read if you work with generative models and have wondered why your overparameterized network doesn't just regurgitate training examples, or if you want principled guidance on when to stop training.\n\nRead and ask questions on ChapterPal: https://t.co/gyXAXq8CU2\n\nPDF: https://t.co/URyLJYzgte",

For example, if there is a fire truck across the road, a bunch of cones, and a police officer directing traffic, the road is likely closed. It is not that hard to figure out a road closure nowadays with computer vision and multimodal models.\n\nWhen a road is closed, you simply look for other routes\u2014that is what we do as human beings. If we hit another road closure, we reroute again.\n\nThe neat thing about AI is that it can see everything in real time and provide much better information. Consider how many Teslas might be around a closed block\u2014if there are a hundred, Tesla Corporation should have the information to identify all road closures immediately after they happen. The system can then:\n1. Put that information on the map\n2. Inform the human driver\n3.

More importantly, why don't companies stay there?\n\nIt's because they don't have as much of an economic or environmental interest to start companies in those locations. But this can all move, and it can move fast. \n\nYou are signaling to the richest people\u2014the ones who hire all of us. I'm not rich, and I need to have a job. The jobs follow the rich people who invest in these companies. If you move the rich people out of town, all of a sudden, the whole ecosystem starts moving away.",
