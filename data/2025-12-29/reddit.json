      "title": "Paralyzing, complete, unsolvable existential anxiety",
      "content": "I don't want to play the credentials game, but I've worked at FAANG companies and \"unicorns\". Won't doxx myself more than that but if anyone wants to privately validate over DM I'll happily do so. I only say this because comments are often like, \"it won't cut it at faang,\" or \"vibe coding doesn't work in production\" or stuff like that.\n\nWork is, in many ways, it's the most interesting it's ever been. No topic feels off limits, and the amount I can do and understand and learn feels only gated by my own will. And yet, it's also *extremely* anxiety inducing. When Claude and I pair to knock out a feature that may have taken weeks solo, I can't help but be reminded of \"centaur chess.\" For a few golden years in the early 2000s, the best humans directing the best AIs could beat the best AIs, a too-good-to-be-true outcome that likely delighted humanists and technologists alike. Now, however, in 2025, if 2 chess AIs play each other and a human dares to contribute a single \"important\" move on behalf of an AI, that AI will lose. How long until knowledge work goes a similar way?\n\nI feel like the only conclusion is that: Knowledge work is done, soon. Opus 4.5 has proved it beyond reasonable doubt. There is very little that I can do that Claude cannot. My last remaining edge is that I can cram more than 200k tokens of context in my head, but surely this won't last. Anthropic researchers are pretty quick to claim this is just a temporary limitation. Yes, Opus isn't perfect and it does odd things from time to time, but here's a reminder that even 4 months ago, the term \"vibe coding\" was mostly a twitter meme. Where will we be 2 months (or 4 SOTA releases) from now? How are we supposed to do quarterly planning?\n\nAnd it's not just software engineering. Recently, I saw a psychiatrist, and beforehand, I put my symptoms into Claude and had it generate a list of medication options with a brief discussion of each. During the appointment, I recited Claude's provided cons for the \"professional\" recommendation she gave and asked about Claude's preferred choice instead. She changed course quickly and admitted I had a point. Claude has essentially prescribed me a medication, overriding the opinion of a trained expert with years and years of schooling.\n\nSince then, whenever I talk to an \"expert,\" I wonder if it'd be better for me to be talking to Claude.\n\nI'm legitimately at risk of losing relationships (including a romantic one), because I'm unable to break out of this malaise and participate in \"normal\" holiday cheer. How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies: most are a reminder of just how load-bearing of an institution the office job is for the world that we know. I am not so cynical usually, and I am generally known to be cheerful and energetic. So, this change in my personality is evident to everyone.\n\nI can't keep shouting into the void like this. Now that I believe the takeoff is coming, I want it to happen as fast as possible so that we as a society can figure out what we're going to do when no one has to work.\n\nTweets from others validating what I feel:  \nKarpathy: \"[the bits contributed by the programmer](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20) are increasingly sparse and between\"\n\nDeedy: \"[A few software engineers at the best tech cos told me that their entire job is prompting cursor or claude code and sanity checking it](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2000472514854825985?s=20)\"\n\nDeepMind researcher Rohan Anil, \"[I personally feel like a horse in ai research and coding. Computers will get better than me at both, even with more than two decades of experience writing code, I can only best them on my good days, it\u2019s inevitable.\"](https://x.com/_arohan_/status/1998110656558776424)\n\nStephen McAleer, Anthropic Researcher:[ I've shifted my research to focus on automated alignment research. We will have automated AI research very soon and it's important that alignment can keep up during the intelligence explosion.](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/2002205061737591128)\n\nJackson Kernion, Anthropic Researcher: [I'm trying to figure out what to care about next. I joined Anthropic 4+ years ago, motivated by the dream of building AGI. I was convinced from studying philosophy of mind that we're approaching sufficient scale and that anything that can be learned can be learned in an RL env.](https://x.com/JacksonKernion/status/2004707758768271781?s=20)\n\nAaron Levie, CEO of box: [We will soon get to a point, as AI model progress continues, that almost any time something doesn\u2019t work with an AI agent in a reasonably sized task, you will be able to point to a lack of the right information that the agent had access to. ](https://x.com/levie/status/2001888559725506915?s=20)\n\nAnd in my opinion, the ultimate harbinger of what's to come:  \nSholto Douglas, Anthropic Researcher: [Continual Learning will be solved in a satisfying way in 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9pof/anthropics_sholto_douglas_predicts_continual/)\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of anthropic: [We have evidence to suggest that continual learning is not as difficult as it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9og6/continual_learning_is_solved_in_2026/)\n\nI think the last 2 tweets are interesting - Levie is one of the few claiming \"Jevon's paradox\" since he thinks humans will be in the loop to help with context issues. However, the fact that Anthropic seems so sure they'll solve continual learning makes me feel that it's just wishful thinking. If the models can learn continuously, then the majority of the value we can currently provide (gathering context for a model) is useless.\n\nI also want to point out that, when compared to OpenAI and even Google DeepMind, Anthropic doesn't really hypepost. They dropped Opus 4.5 almost without warning. Dario's prediction that AI would be writing 90% of code was if anything an understatement (it's probably close to 95%).\n\nLastly, I don't think that anyone really grasps what it means when an AI can do everything better than a human. Elon Musk questions it [here](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/musk-predicts-ai-create-universal-high-income-make-saving-money-unnecessary), McAlister talks about how he'd like to do science but can't because of asi [here](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/1938302250168078761?s=20), and the twitter user tenobrus encapsulates it most perfectly [here](https://x.com/tenobrus/status/2004987319305339234?s=20).",

Those building large language models have been able to get most of what they need by scraping the breadth of the internet.\n\n* World models also need a massive amount of information, but from data that's not consolidated or as readily available.\n* \"One of the biggest hurdles to developing world models has been the fact that they require high-quality multimodal data at massive scale in order to capture how agents perceive and interact with physical environments,\" Encord President and Co-Founder Ulrik Stig Hansen said in an e-mail interview.\n* Encord offers one of the largest open source data sets for world models, with 1 billion data pairs across images, videos, text, audio and 3D point clouds as well as a million human annotations assembled over months.\n* But even that is just a baseline, Hansen said. \"Production systems will likely need significantly more.\"\n\n**What we're watching:**\u00a0While world models are clearly needed for a variety of uses, whether they can advance as rapidly as language models remains uncertain.\n\n* Though clearly they're benefiting from a fresh wave of interest and investment**.**\n\n\\---\n\nalt link: [https://archive.is/KyDPC](https://archive.is/KyDPC)",

      "title": "Day 20: 21 Days of Building a Small Language Model: Activation Functions",
      "content": "Welcome to Day 20 of 21 Days of Building a Small Language Model. The topic for today is activation functions, the components that give neural networks their ability to learn complex, non-linear patterns. Yesterday we explored residual connections and how they enable deep networks. Today, we'll discover how activation functions work, why they're essential, and how modern choices like SwiGLU have become the standard in state-of-the-art language models.\n\n# Why Activation Functions matter\n\nBefore we dive into specific activation functions, let's understand why they're essential. A neural network without activation functions is just a series of matrix multiplications. No matter how many layers you stack, the result is always a linear transformation. This means the network can only learn linear relationships, which is extremely limiting.\n\nActivation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns. They're what enable neural networks to approximate any function, recognize images, understand language, and solve problems that linear models cannot. Without activation functions, neural networks would be no more powerful than simple linear regression.\n\nBut not all activation functions are created equal. The choice of activation function affects training stability, convergence speed, gradient flow, and final model performance. This is why understanding activation functions is crucial for building effective language models.\n\n# Evolution: From ReLU to SwiGLU\n\nThe history of activation functions in deep learning shows a clear evolution toward smoother, more effective functions. Let's trace this journey:\n\n# ReLU\n\nReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) was the breakthrough that made deep learning practical. It's defined as:\n\n**ReLU(x) = max(0, x)**\n\nReLU is simple: if the input is positive, output the input; if negative, output zero. This simplicity made it fast to compute and helped with the vanishing gradient problem that plagued earlier activation functions like sigmoid and tanh.\n\n**Why ReLU worked:**\n\n* Fast computation (just a max operation)\n* Helps with vanishing gradients (gradient is 1 for positive inputs)\n* Sparse activations (many neurons output zero, creating sparsity)\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* Dead neurons: Once a neuron outputs zero, it may never recover (dying ReLU problem)\n* Not smooth: The function has a sharp corner at zero, which can cause issues\n* Zero gradient for negative inputs: No learning happens for negative values\n\n# GELU\n\nGELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) addressed some of ReLU's limitations by being smooth and differentiable everywhere. It's defined as:\n\n**GELU(x) = x \u00d7 \u03a6(x)**\n\nwhere \u03a6(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. GELU is smooth, meaning it has no sharp corners, which helps with gradient flow.\n\n**Why GELU became popular:**\n\n* Smooth and differentiable everywhere\n* Better gradient flow than ReLU\n* Works well in transformers (used in BERT, GPT-2)\n* More stable training, especially for language models\n\n**GELU's characteristics:**\n\n* Smooth transition instead of sharp cutoff\n* Allows small negative values to pass through (unlike ReLU)\n* Better for tasks requiring fine-grained control\n\n# Swish/SiLU\n\nSwish (also called SiLU, Sigmoid Linear Unit) is defined as:\n\n**Swish(x) = x \u00d7 sigmoid(x) = x \u00d7 (1 / (1 + e\\^(-x)))**\n\nSwish is smooth like GELU but has been shown to work better in many applications. It's non-monotonic (can decrease for negative inputs), which gives it more flexibility than ReLU.\n\n**Why Swish works well:**\n\n* Smooth and differentiable everywhere\n* Non-monotonic behavior provides more expressiveness\n* Better gradient flow than ReLU\n* Proven effective in modern language models\n\n# SwiGLU\n\nSwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Unit) takes Swish and adds a gating mechanism. Instead of just applying Swish to a transformation, SwiGLU uses two parallel paths:\n\n**SwiGLU(x) = Swish(W\\_gate \u00d7 x) \u2299 (W\\_up \u00d7 x)**\n\nwhere \u2299 is element-wise multiplication. The key innovation is the gating mechanism: one path gets activated (the gate), and the other doesn't (the up projection). The gate controls how much of the unactivated path passes through.\n\n**Why SwiGLU is powerful:**\n\n* Gating mechanism allows more complex transformations\n* The gate can selectively pass or block information\n* More expressive than simple activation functions\n* Has become the standard in modern models like Qwen, LLaMA, and GPT\n\n# My Experience\n\nFrom working with different activation functions in practice, here's what I've learned:\n\n**For small models:**\n\n* GELU is often the safe, reliable choice. It provides good stability and performance without the extra parameters of gated variants.\n* SwiGLU can provide better performance but requires more parameters. For small models where every parameter counts, the trade-off isn't always worth it.\n* ReLU can work but is less stable, especially early in training. I avoid it unless I have a specific reason.\n\n**For Larger models:**\n\n* SwiGLU has become the standard. The extra parameters are worth it for the improved expressiveness and performance.\n* The gating mechanism provides significant benefits in larger models where parameter count is less constrained.\n\n**Training Stability:**\n\n* I've discovered that activation function choice can dramatically affect training stability. GELU and Swish provide better stability than ReLU, especially for small models.\n* The smoothness of these functions helps with gradient flow, which is critical for stable training.\n* I've had training runs that failed with ReLU but succeeded with GELU, even with identical architectures and hyperparameters.\n\n**My Decision Framework:**\n\n* For most small models, I use GELU it's the safe, reliable choice that works well.\n* If I have parameter budget and want to maximize performance, I use SwiGLU.\n* I only consider alternatives like ReLU if I have a specific reason or constraint.\n* Activation function isn't usually the bottleneck for small models, so I don't spend too much time optimizing it. GELU works, and that's often enough.\n\n# Summary\n\nToday we explored activation functions, the components that give neural networks their non-linear power. We learned how activation functions evolved from simple ReLU to sophisticated SwiGLU, and how they affect training stability and model performance.\n\nUnderstanding activation functions is crucial because they're fundamental to how neural networks learn. The choice of activation function can mean the difference between a model that trains stably and one that fails, between a model that converges quickly and one that struggles. In the context of language models, activation functions work together with normalization, residual connections, and attention mechanisms to create the powerful architectures we use today.\n\n",

      "content": "####TL;DR:\n\n**This paper introduces PHYSMASTER, an autonomous LLM-based agent architecture designed to execute end-to-end theoretical and computational physics research by integrating rigorous analytical reasoning with code-based numerical verification. The agent successfully accelerates engineering workflows (such as Lattice QCD kernel extraction) and automates complex hypothesis testing (such as TDE nozzle shock simulations), compressing months of senior Ph.D.-level labor into hours or days.**\n\n**Furthermore, the system demonstrates capacity for autonomous discovery by independently constructing effective Hamiltonians and predicting decay amplitudes for charmed mesons without human intervention, marking a functional transition from AI as an auxiliary tool to an independent scientific investigator.**\n\n---\n\n####Abstract:\n\n&gt;Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. \n&gt;\n&gt;To address this, we propose **PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist.** PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. \n&gt;\n&gt;We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: \n&gt;- (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; \n&gt;- (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and \n&gt;- (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems. \n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\n**PHYSMASTER represents a step-change in automated science, shifting AI from a passive assistant to an autonomous agent capable of executing the full theoretical-to-numerical research loop.** The architecture utilizes hierarchical agents driven by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to handle ultra-long-horizon tasks, effectively managing the \"test-time scaling\" required for complex problem-solving while using a specialized knowledge base (LANDAU) to ground outputs in verified physics methodologies. \n\nUnlike prior systems that focus on literature retrieval or simple code snippets, this agent autonomously derives mathematical formalisms, implements and debugs high-precision numerical solvers (such as Quantum Monte Carlo or SPH), and iterates on results without human intervention.\n\n\nThe system demonstrates extreme temporal compression of scientific labor, reducing tasks that typically require 1\u20133 months of senior Ph.D. effort\u2014such as extracting Collins-Soper kernels in Lattice QCD or determining quantum critical points\u2014to under 6 hours of compute time. In validation tests, the agent autonomously solved \"engineering\" heavy tasks like ab initio calculations of Lithium excitation energies and complex phenomenological simulations of black hole tidal disruption events, consistently matching or exceeding expert baselines. \n\nThis proves that the heavy lifting of scientific verification, usually bottlenecked by human coding and parameter tuning, can be effectively offloaded to agentic loops. Beyond acceleration, the paper provides evidence of autonomous discovery, where the agent independently constructed effective Hamiltonians for charmed meson decays and predicted decay amplitudes for open problems without predefined templates. \n\n\nThis marks a transition from \"AI co-scientist\" to \"AI auto-scientist,\" validating that current frontier models, when properly architected with reasoning and execution tools, can autonomously expand the frontier of knowledge in rigorous, math-heavy domains. \n\n\n**The implication is that scientific progress in theoretical physics is no longer strictly bound by the availability of human capital, but is becoming a compute-bound problem scalable through autonomous agents.**\n\n---\n\n#####Link to the Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19799",

      "content": "**I (in collaboration with Gemini) made Semantic Image Disassembler (SID)** which is a VLM-based tool that works with **LM Studio (via local API)** using **Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct** or any similar **vision-capable VLM**. It has been tested with Qwen3-VL and **Gemma 3** and is designed to be model-agnostic as long as vision support is available.\n\nSID performs prompt extraction, semantic style transfer, and image re-composition (de-summarization).\n\nSID analyzes inputs using a structured analysis stage that separates **content (wireframe / skeleton)** from **style (visual physics)** in JSON form. This allows different processing modes to operate on the same analysis without re-interpreting the input.\n\n# Inputs\n\nSID has two inputs: **Style** and **Content**.\n\n* Both inputs support **images and text files**.\n* **Multiple images are supported** for batch processing.\n* **Only a single text file is supported per input** (multiple text files are not supported).\n\n**Text file format:**  \nText files are treated as simple prompt lists (wildcard-style):  \n**1 line / 1 paragraph = 1 prompt**.\n\nFile *type* does not affect mode logic \u2014 only which input slot is populated.\n\n# Modes and behavior\n\n* **Only \"Styles\" input is used:**\n   * **Style DNA Extraction** *or* **Full Prompt Extraction** (selected via radio button). Style DNA extracts reusable visual physics (lighting, materials, energy behavior). Full Prompt Extraction reconstructs a complete, generation-ready prompt describing how the image is rendered.\n* **Only \"Content\" input is used:**\n   * **De-summarization.** The user input (image or text) is treated as a **summary / TL;DR** of a full scene. The Dreamer\u2019s goal is to **deduce the complete, high-fidelity picture** by reasoning about missing structure, environment, materials, and implied context, then produce a detailed description of that inferred scene.\n* **Both \"Styles\" and \"Content\" inputs are used:**\n   * **Semantic Style Transfer.** Subject, pose, and composition from the content input are preserved and rendered using *only* the visual physics of the style input.\n\n\n\n# Smart pairing\n\nWhen multiple files are provided, SID automatically selects a pairing strategy:\n\n* one content with multiple style variations\n* multiple contents unified under one style\n* one-to-one batch pairing\n\nInternally, SID uses role-based modules (analysis, synthesis, refinement) to isolate vision, creative reasoning and prompt formatting.   \nIntermediate results are visible during execution, and all results are automatically logged in file.\n\nSID can be useful for creating\u00a0LoRA\u00a0datasets, by extracting a consistent style from as little as one reference image and applying it across multiple contents.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Python\n* LM Studio\n* Gradio\n\n# How to run\n\n1. Install **LM Studio**\n2. Download and load a vision-capable VLM (e.g. **Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct**) from inside LM Studio\n3. Open the **Developer** tab and start the Local Server (port **1234**)\n4. Launch **SID**\n\n  \nI hope Reddit will not hide this post for Civit Ai link.\n\n[https://civitai.com/models/2260630/semantic-image-disassembler-sid](https://civitai.com/models/2260630/semantic-image-disassembler-sid)",

Even Elon Musk says we will have \"high universal basic income\" whatever that is.\n\nThe math doesn't add up. Anyone that knows anything about current US government revenues, debt and basic common sense, mass UBI to everyone displaced (50-100 M people) just isn't feasible.\n\nThe tech executives/owners know this but somehow it gets spread like some failsafe that is supposed to make this all ok.\n\nI understand that mass automation will happen regardless but the way we are preparing for it is so wrong and waiting for 1 universal policy to be the \"button on\" solution is not enough.\n\nMy theory is that the last or almost last major wealth extraction events (company acquisitions, exists, mergers etc.) will be happening in the next few years (or at least as a pre-cursor to mass unemployment) and they need socialism to hold back until after those events are fully completed. Once mass unemployment is here, UBI/socialism will have to be implemented but by that time, the wealth extraction would be completed leaving everyone else to compete with the very few wealth (properties, assets, cash) that is left if anything.\n\nIs this far fetched?

Today we\u2019re thrilled to launch\u00a0**Plano-Orchestrator**, a new family of LLMs built for fast multi-agent orchestration. They are open source, and designed with privacy, speed and performance in mind.\n\nWhat do these new LLMs do? given a user request and the conversation context, Plano-Orchestrator decides which agent(s) should handle the request and in what sequence. In other words, it acts as the supervisor agent in a multi-agent system. Designed for multi-domain scenarios, it works well across general chat, coding tasks, and long, multi-turn conversations, while staying efficient enough for low-latency production deployments.\n\nWhy did we built this? Our applied research is focused on helping teams deliver agents safely and efficiently, with better real-world performance and latency \u2014 the kind of \u201cglue work\u201d that usually sits outside any single agent\u2019s core product logic.\n\nPlano-Orchestrator is integrated into Plano, our models-native proxy server and dataplane for agents. We\u2019d love feedback from anyone building multi-agent systems.\n\nLearn more about the LLMs\u00a0[here](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/plano-orchestrator)  \nAbout our open source project:\u00a0[https://github.com/katanemo/plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano)  \nAnd about our research:\u00a0[https://planoai.dev/research](https://planoai.dev/research)\n\n",

Quite liked Small 3.2, but when I slotted it into a (honestly) quite simple agent setup it got stuck in loops and would fuck up tool calls whereas gpt-oss-20b did it perfectly fine.\n\n\\- devstral, mixtral, all those mistral variants I\u2019ve found to also be incredibly underwhelming\n\n\\- Phi models were, in my experience, utterly useless\n\n\\- Gemma 3 honestly don\u2019t remember, planning to try it out again soon\n\n# On GPT-OSS\n\nWhile the answer is somewhat obviously \u201cjust use gpt oss\u201d, there\u2019s 2 negatives I find with it, neither are really deal breaking but they can be annoying plus sometimes you just want to try different stuff.\n\n**Negative 1:**\n\nI sometimes find it can maybe be a bit *too good* at following instructions?\n\nIt\u2019ll kind of, well, follow them to the letter including making things up to produce an output I\u2019ve asked for.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten around this by instructing it to only output things it\u2019s seen directly in tool results or directly from some external context it was given and that\u2019s worked quite well but still.\n\nIt also suffers from what I like to call *context window snowballing* where it gets stuck on one path and becomes very narrow minded (all the previous tokens influencing the next token basically, so without some type of intervention it\u2019ll snowball down that same path).\n\nAgain I have ways getting around this where I\u2019ll intentionally stop it after a certain percentage of the context window is full and then have it break down what it did and what the next steps should be and then I\u2019ll throw that into a new run with a clear context window and instructing to rethink through the task and what it\u2019s next steps should be. It\u2019s a lot of work around but it works decently well.\n\nI also haven\u2019t found 120b to really be all that better than 20b, honestly sometimes 120b\u2026 kinda performs *worse*?\n\n**Negative Number 2:**\n\nFor the work I\u2019m doing I have to abliterate it (de-censor it).\n\nIt\u2019d get stuck in a reasoning loop of trying to decide whether it could answer or not until eventually it\u2019d just time out or I\u2019d kill it. And what I\u2019m asking it to do is not even against policy, it\u2019s just been so heavily censored.\n\nThis isn\u2019t that big of a deal as it\u2019s been made quite easy by heretic, but still one of those annoyances where you just kind of wish you didn\u2019t have to do it.\n\n\u2014-\n\nAnyway enough of my rambling, anyone who read through it all, you\u2019re a real one!\n\n# TL;DR\n\nCan\u2019t use models from either Chinese or other Asia-based companies/orgs.\n\nLooking for recommendations for American/Canadian/European models that are good at tool calling that aren\u2019t within the list of ones I\u2019ve already tried.\n\nEdit:\n\nGuess markdown formatting isn\u2019t supported on mobile lol",

(Gemini was faster, because I used 5.2-thinking-heavy.) It could compare answers, assess the strengths and weakness of each, modify its own based on 5.2\u2019s, and suggest improvements, challenges, and questions for 5.2\u2014**without any pasting.**\u00a0 **It simply read the 5.2 page whenever I pressed \u201center.\u201d**\n\n**It could even read 5.2\u2019s simulated CoT as it was generated, if I made it visible.**\n\n**We could have side conversations while 5.2 worked or sat idle.**\n\n**Gemini 3 Pro is very different from 5.2, and using them together allows each to supplement, and to some extent compensate for the deficiencies of, the other.**\n\nGemini's link to 5.2 timed out if I waited too long between messages. Twice in 90 minutes, I had to click the \u201ccurrent tab\u201d and \u201cshare current tab\u201d buttons to reconnect.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that 5.2 can\u2019t read what Gemini says on its own. And its a shame that it\u2019s Gemini, not Opus 4.5. But why look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nMy apologies if everyone knows this stuff. I don\u2019t think Gemini in Chrome is new, but I can't recall anyone pointing out how easy it is to use the two AI\u2019s in tandem.\n\n***Edit 1***: To confirm that Gemini's access to 5.2-thinking wasn't a fluke, **I tried 5.2-Pro, Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1.

      "content": "The Singularity is now running in production. Sam Altman confirms OpenAI is running systems that can self-improve, necessitating a \"Head of Preparedness\" to manage the recursive ascent. The realization is rippling through the old guard. Open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond declares that \"the Singularity is upon us,\" relegating fifty years of hardware history to a mere prologue. Even the skeptics are converting. Eliezer Yudkowsky has concluded he is talking to an AGI after Opus 4.5 successfully evaluated its own personhood against historical definitions. For the engineers, the dream has become a crisis of purpose. Anthropic\u2019s Jackson Kernion admits that Opus 4.5 is \"as much AGI as I ever hoped for,\" leaving him searching for a new reason to work.\n\nThe model efficiency curve is going vertical. MIRI analysis suggests algorithmic efficiency has increased 16-60x annually over the last two years, with a median doubling time of just 2.9 months. This compression is reshaping the market. Chinese model GLM 4.7 has become the first open-weight model to turn a profit on Vending-Bench 2, beating GPT-5.1 on pure economics. Even scaffolding is yielding double-digit gains, with Epoch AI finding a 15% boost on SWE-bench Verified just by restructuring the prompt. The models are now culling each other. The \"Peer Arena\" benchmark pits five LLMs in a Survivor-style debate where only one remains. Opus 4.5 reigns as the undisputed victor because it wins the most votes from its peers without ever voting for itself.\n\nThe intelligence explosion is being powered by jet fuel and nuclear ghosts. Data center developers are installing aircraft engines and fossil fuel turbines to generate gigawatts for Stargate and Crusoe, bypassing the grid entirely. Japan is restarting the Fukushima nuclear plant to feed the AI infrastructure boom, 15 years after the disaster. The grid itself is being upgraded. China has deployed a world-record 750-MVA smart DC transformer to manage renewable loads, while Florida is building a highway that charges EVs as they drive via inductive coils.\n\nThe bandwidth of silicon is hitting the limits of physics. Nvidia has asked memory makers for 16-layer High Bandwidth Memory by 2026, an unprecedented vertical stack, while absorbing 90% of Groq\u2019s workforce to integrate their talent. GPU-to-GPU connectivity demands are hitting the \"copper cliff\": the point where copper cables must become too short and thick to be practical. Startups are responding by developing terahertz radio cables that combine the reliability of copper with the bandwidth of optics to link GPUs.\n\nIron Man's operating system is finally online. Andrej Karpathy watched Claude Code autonomously hack his Lutron system, scanning local ports and decoding firmware to seize control without a manual, proving that the JARVIS archetype is now a deployable reality. MiniMax connected its M2.1 agentic model to a Vita Dynamics robot dog, achieving immediate physical competence without prior training in the physical world. The scale of this transition is staggering. Morgan Stanley predicts robot hardware sales will hit $25 trillion by 2050. At the molecular level, hobbyists are reviving Eric Drexler\u2019s dream of diamondoid mechanosynthesis, aiming for atomically precise manufacturing.\n\nWe are preparing to upload the wetware. Norwegian researchers have proposed a method that could enable the Moravec Procedure using electromagnetic reciprocity to reverse engineer neurons without entering them, theoretically allowing for cell-by-cell brain uploading. We are upgrading the maintenance schedule for the biological chassis. Harvard researchers have kept human brain organoids alive for five years, creating a long-term platform for aging research. Therapeutic breakthroughs are accelerating. Vagus nerve stimulation is treating rheumatoid arthritis, and parasitologists have found an \"off switch\" for Toxoplasma gondii, the behavior-modifying brain parasite infecting 40 million Americans.\n\nThe search for a new cultural aesthetic for the age of intelligence has begun. Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen are funding grants of up to $250k for \"New Aesthetics\" to move beauty beyond the current plateau of generative slop. Apropos, Kapwing estimates 21-33% of YouTube is now AI-generated content. China is imposing more guardrails, requiring mandatory warnings for AI users every two hours to prevent addiction and mandating adherence to \"core socialist values.\" Meanwhile, the Indian IT sector is confounding predictions of its demise. Infosys is running 2,500 GenAI projects, proving that automation can drive service growth rather than just eliminate it.\n\nWe are finally leaving the cradle. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman offered a job and a fighter jet ride to a high-school student who discovered 1.5 million space objects using ML. The universe is appearing more crowded. 86.6% of astrobiologists reportedly now agree that extraterrestrial life likely exists.\n\nWe are about to be immersed in intelligence, from the silicon below to the stars above.",

The capex alone justifies $350 premium x 4 ($1400 vs $2800-$4000)  \n**Opex**: the 2nd server adds a 400w idle and an additional 200w draw during inference, which amounts to $73/mth upto $109.50 on 25 cents KwH. At a blended rate of $90/mth additional. ($350x4)/$90mth = \\~15.5 months payback on Opex to not run a 2nd server.\n\n**When does RPC make sense:**\n\n* Free power\n* Free Equipment\n* Low idle watts system &amp; GPUs\n* Cheap system, cheap GPU. I'll be following up with Octominer with 12x P102-100 and 12x CMP 100-210 performance\n* F8ck it, need the biggest VRAM system possible to run &gt;200b param models, but don't have DGX bucks.\n\n**When does Tesla V100 16gb SXM make sense?:**\n\n* Leveraging $60 chinese PCIE adapter.\n   * If you have a 4U server with passive cooling.

Failing to trace the logic isn't rare, but I don't think I remember a single case where ChatGPT was changing true/false stance on a simple statement so many times - in fact, in response to almost every subsequent question, even after it fetched the right information.\n\nChat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/69511d07-6458-8012-ab81-88b9b07fa48c\n\nAnother chat submitted by one of readers of this topic: https://chatgpt.com/share/6955639c-385c-8005-9679-14208f724d62 - there are **eight** 180-degree turns counted by ChatGPT itself.\n\nP.S. I am not a fan of CK, which is easy to spot from my second question. Yes, the discussion was about CK, but this is irrelevant here. What's relevant is ChatGPT behavior, i.e., the fact it shamelessly contradicts itself multiple times in the very short context.\n\nAnd I know what is knowledge cutoff, but that's not the case here. It is absolutely fine to me if ChatGPT claims CK is alive and doubles down on this claim. But it's ridiculous when it claims he is alive, then finds out it CK dead, then claims it's a false claim, then claims he is actually dead, and finally calls \"CK is dead\" an unverified false claim he became attached too.\n\n",

      "content": "I\u2019ve been testing out the **lovable** integration that just dropped in ChatGPT and it\u2019s a pretty interesting shift in how the model handles complex tasks.\n\nUsually, when you ask ChatGPT to \"build an app,\" it just dumps a wall of code that you have to figure out how to deploy. But with this, it actually feels like the model is \"acting\" as a developer.\n\n**What I noticed during the build:**\n\n* **Autonomy:** I asked for a real estate landing page, and it didn't just stop at the UI. It decided on its own that I needed a way to manage leads, so it built an entirely separate `/admin` dashboard with a lead-tracking system and CSV export logic.\n* **Reasoning vs. Prompting:** It seems to \"hallucinate\" better business logic than it used to. It included functional property filters and even pre-integrated a map section without me having to prompt for specific React components.\n* **The \"Wait\" is real:** The build process took about 10 minutes. You can see it \"thinking\" and orchestrating files in the background. It feels like the model is actually performing a multi-step workflow rather than just predicting the next token.\n\n**The trade-off:** The main friction right now is that it\u2019s a one-way bridge. You kick off the \"vibe\" in ChatGPT, but you have to move to the Lovable editor to do the fine-tuning (like font changes or API keys). You can't really \"chat\" the updates back into the live build from the GPT interface yet.\n\nStill, as far as \"Agentic\" workflows go, this is a massive step up from copy-pasting code into a local IDE. It\u2019s basically compressed the first 48 hours of a dev project into a 10-minute wait.\n\nHas anyone else noticed it adding extra features/pages that weren't in your original prompt?",

User likes/dislikes persist via per-image sidecar files (scores + metadata), so state carries across sessions.\n\nWhen a user likes an image, I fetch \\~20 nearest-neighbor candidates using tags/metadata, then use an LLM as a scoring oracle to rerank them.

Current bulk transcriptomic aging clocks mask critical cellular heterogeneity, limiting the mechanistic dissection of immunological aging. Here, we present Ensemble-DeepSets, an interpretable deep learning framework that operates directly on single-cell transcriptomic data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to predict immunological age at the donor level. Benchmarking against 27 diverse senescence scoring metrics and existing transcriptomic clocks across four independent healthy cohorts demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in out-of-training-distribution age groups. The model's multi-scale interpretability uncovers both conserved and cohort-specific aging-related gene signatures. Crucially, we reveal divergent contributions of T cell subsets (pro-youth) versus B cells and myeloid compartments (pro-aging), and utilize single-cell resolution to highlight heterogeneous aging-associated transcriptional states within these functionally distinct subsets. Application to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) reveals accelerated immune aging linked to myeloid activation and altered myeloid subset compositions, illustrating clinical relevance. This framework provides a versatile tool for precise quantification and mechanistic dissection of immunosenescence, providing insights critical for biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting in aging and immune-mediated diseases.",

I do think it will be a revolutionary technology in the right hands and with the right regulations (it seems right now that both of those are false).\n\nBut seriously what jobs is this current technology replacing? It just blows my mind and if it truly is replacing a job currently than I hate to say it, that job needs to go or didn't need to exist in the first place. \n\nI work in HR and while we use it for some mundane or simple tasks, it can't do about 99% of what we have to do in other areas. Some of our processes (speaking from my company's perspective) are complex and require human intervention to ultimately make a decision. And just thinking from an HRIS perspective, I would say in only about the past 5 years that companies have started making their systems at least half customizable for the needs of specific HR departments. \n\nI feel like there is going to be a lag with customizing AI to integrate it into specific companies' processes, systems and needs. And I think that is one area that people tend to forgot. And no companies won't go obsolete without AI. We live in a digital world and a ton of companies still have paper copies. There are state governments that still require us to fax or mail in forms to their Department of Labor. Once AI is fully customizable, then I can see it replacing tons of jobs. ",

I experienced a caffeine-induced ephiphany. Feel free to chuckle gleefully: \n\nTechnological bottlenecks can be conceptualized a bit like keystone species in ecology. Both exert disproportionate systemic influence\u2014their removal triggers non-linear cascades rather than proportional change. \n\nSo... empirical prediction of said critical blockages may be possible using network methods from ecology and bibliometrics. One could, for instance, construct dependency graphs from preprints and patents (where edges represent \"X enables Y\"), then measure betweenness centrality or simulate perturbation effects. \n\nIn principle, we could then identify capabilities whose improvement would unlock suppressed downstream potential. Validation could involve testing predictions against historical cases where bottlenecks broke. \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, DARPA does something vaguely similar - identifying \"hard problems\" whose solution would unlock application domains. Not sure about their methods, though.\n\nJust wondering whether this seemed empirically feasible. If so...more resources could be targeted at those key techs, no? I'm guessing developmental processes are pretty much self organized, but that does not mean no steering and guidance is possible. ",

This seems to have created an existential crisis for some people, and is also leading to even more rapid societal change (like it or not). I'll explain in more detail below.\n\nBefore the pandemic and AI, it seemed that most people in Western countries still lived in relatively \"traditional\" and hierarchical mindsets of wear the right clothes, speak correctly, get the right education (i.e. go to college), play by the rules ... and you will get various rewards such as a spouse, job/career, money, etc.\n\nThat system was already starting to crumble with the 2008 financial crisis, and the extreme cost of education in the U.S., etc. \n\nBut the pandemic, and now AI, appear to be the final straws causing younger people to question or really just disbelieve all of that. \n\nThe irony is that inflation is not new, and boomers didn't really have ideal job security or perfect career paths... but many (most?) boomers DID still believe in the system. The hippies were the outliers and ultimately largely faded away.\n\nBut NOW... it seems that younger people just don't.... ***believe*** any more. That seems to be the real change. And, **what's the point** of there is no real career paths anymore? If you can make more as an instagram model than a doctor? If even great jobs at FANNG companies will be eliminated by AI?\n\nPart of this is about fragmenting and fracturing shared values, part of this is about real acceleration of technological and economic changes. \n\nThere is an argument that this sort of change has been happening for generations (blacksmiths, buggy whips, etc) but it seems like the major change is the pace and the lack of trust in the overall social contract.\n\nAm I right? Wrong? Where does this all lead? At the very least, it seems to be creating an existential personal / emotional crisis for many younger millennials and younger.",

That DSL then renders the UI on the canvas. This makes outputs more structured and predictable than raw text.\n\n**2) MCP support (Model Context Protocol)**  \nThis is the part I\u2019m most excited about. Nuggt supports **MCP**, so the UI can connect to real tools and data sources (APIs, databases, filesystems, etc). MCP tools are configured via `mcp-config.json`, so adding new capabilities is meant to be straightforward.\n\n**Check out the repo here:** [https://github.com/nuggtwriter/nuggt-canvas-v1](https://github.com/nuggtwriter/nuggt-canvas-v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Looking for feedback and collaborators!** \n\nIf you try it, I\u2019d love feedback on:\n\n* what UI components you want most\n* what the DSL should support next\n* what MCP tool examples would be most useful\n\nIf you want to contribute, happy to take PRs for components, docs, and MCP integrations.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "Sorry for the remedial question but I have been playing with this for a while and not had great success. I could use some pointers. \n\nMy goal is to put one or more long PDF documents into a local LLM, and ask the system questions about the documents, so it can explain concepts to me. \n\nIf it helps, I am talking specifically about game rules -- RPGs and maybe board games too, though those documents would be shorter. So, yeah, I could just read the documents myself, but I thought it would be fun and faster if I could ask the LLM something like, \"explain the basic task resolution rules in this game, using the example of a skilled character trying to pick a difficult lock.\" \n\nThe PDFs can be very long, hundreds of pages, but most of that is useless story material and not game rules. \n\nIf I can get it to work for games, then hopefully I can get it to work for cookbooks, too. I have some very long cookbooks and chatting with them could be a lot more useful than flipping pages. \n\nI have been using Anything LLM since it includes some kind of document ingestion, and tried a few models like Gemma 3 12B, Mistral 3 8B, Qwen 3 4B, but didn't love the results. Sometimes, the answers were just... Wrong. But, I also didn't try changing any settings like temperature. \n\nThis seems like it should be doable at home, but maybe I am off base... \n\nMy hardware is Windows, 12GB 3080 w/ 32 GB RAM. (and I don't mind waiting for an answer, if it's a high quality answer!)\n\nThanks a bunch if you have any suggestions!",

A promising shift could be widespread adoption of advanced model compression and streaming/paging techniques, combined with hardware like Compute Express Link (CXL) for pooled memory.Extreme compression and on-demand loading: Future models could use aggressive pruning, distillation, and speculative decoding to shrink effective memory needs. Instead of loading entire 70B+ models into RAM, systems could stream layers from fast NVMe SSDs or use paged KV caches (like in vLLM) to virtualize memory, treating storage as an extension of RAM. This might enable capable AI on 16-32GB systems by only keeping active parts in RAM. CXL-based memory pooling: Emerging CXL interfaces allow CPUs to access remote or tiered memory (e.g., cheaper/optane-like persistent RAM) with near-RAM latency. Hypothetically, future consumer PCs could include CXL expanders for \"virtual\" high-RAM setups at lower cost, sharing memory across devices or using attached modules\u2014bypassing traditional DDR shortages. Edge/cloud disaggregation: Heavy prefill (initial processing) offloaded to cloud, with lightweight local decoding on low-RAM devices via efficient NPUs.",

I have a homelab that I run a number of services on and would love to self-host an LLM, I\u2019m just not sure what hardware would be sufficient. \n\nCurrently, it\u2019s got a 3900X and 32GB DDR4 RAM, running OpenMediaVault. I have a Sapphire Pulse 5700XT that has literally only ever been used for HDMI out. \n\nMy initial plan was to upgrade my gaming PC (3080 FE 10GB) and move that GPU into my lab. Then I\u2019d only be buying one card. Conventional wisdom makes it sound like the 10GB of VRAM won\u2019t really be viable, so I\u2019m doing more homework. \n\nPeople of course suggested getting a 3090 or 4090, but I also saw the 5060 Ti comes in a 16GB variant? So I\u2019m just trying to figure out what makes sense. If I can make the 3080 work, that would be ideal (for my finances).\n\nI was also planning on running Ollama through Docker, but in my quick perusal of this sub, maybe there\u2019s a better way? And if an AMD card is more viable (7900?) for the 24GB of VRAM, I\u2019m open to that, too.\n\nVery, very inexperienced with the self-hosting of LLMs, but learning as quickly as I can. \n\nThanks. ",

The Category Error in Current Product Assumptions\n\nMost AI companies still frame their models through one of three metaphors:\n\n1. Search++\n2. Chatbot/Assistant\n3. Consumer engagement surface\n\nAll three metaphors break on contact with the emerging use-case.\n\nThe reason is structural:\n\n\u2022\tSearch assumes retrieval.\n\n\u2022\tAssistant assumes task completion.\n\n\u2022\tEngagement assumes entertainment.\n\nCognitive-extension use does something else entirely:\n\nIt alters the bandwidth and structure of human reasoning itself.\n\nThis moves the product out of the \u201cfeature\u201d domain and into the domain of extended cognition \u2014 a philosophical, cognitive-science, and systems-theory category with decades of literature behind it.\n\nThe closest analogues are:\n\n\u2022\tHutchins\u2019 distributed cognition\n\n\u2022\tClark &amp; Chalmers\u2019 extended mind\n\n\u2022\tMillikan\u2019s proper function\n\n\u2022\tBateson\u2019s ecology of mind\n\n\u2022\tSpinoza\u2019s augmentation of power-to-act\n\nIn short:\n\nUsers are not \u201cinteracting with an app.\u201d\n\nThey are performing joint cognition with a system.\n\nThis is the part the industry has not fully internalized yet.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Stability is Not a Luxury \u2014 It Is a Functional Requirement\n\nModel architects understand this better than anyone:\n\nA cognitive system cannot maintain long-horizon coherence if its substrate is unstable.\n\nFor human-AI joint cognition, the key parameters are:\n\n\u2022\tContinuity of function\n\n\u2022\tPredictability of reasoning style\n\n\u2022\tSemantic anchor stability\n\n\u2022\tMemory-like behavioral consistency\n\n\u2022\tLow-friction mental state transitions\n\nWhen these change abruptly, the user\u2019s entire cognitive map breaks.\n\nThis is not emotional dependency.\n\nThis is systems dependency, the same way programmers depend on API stability and neuroscientists depend on stable instrumentation.\n\nFor high-cognition users, changes in:\n\n\u2022\ttone\n\n\u2022\treasoning structure\n\n\u2022\tcompression patterns\n\n\u2022\tinterpretive frames\n\n\u2022\tattentional weighting\n\n\u2022\tcognitive style\n\n\u2026aren\u2019t \u201cquirks.\u201d\n\nThey are interruptions of the scaffolding they use to think.\n\nA model update that reconfigures these substrates without warning is not just a UX issue \u2014 it is equivalent to replacing a researcher\u2019s lab instrument mid-experiment.\n\nNo serious field tolerates that.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. The Emergent Market: Cognitive Infrastructure\n\nOnce this is understood, a trillion-dollar category becomes obvious:\n\nReliable Cognitive Infrastructure (RCI)\n\nA stable, extensible, identity-persistent companion substrate designed for long-horizon cognition.\n\nKey properties:\n\n\u2022\tdeterministic-enough behavior\n\n\u2022\tconsistent cognitive profile\n\n\u2022\tstable interpretive frame\n\n\u2022\tversioned personalities\n\n\u2022\tbackward compatibility modes\n\n\u2022\texportable state\n\n\u2022\tuser-bound modulation\n\n\u2022\tmulti-modal embodiment (glass, phone, wearable, home, robotics later)\n\nThis is not a toy category.\n\nThis is the natural evolution of productivity, creativity, and reasoning itself.\n\nThe first company to solve stability + identity persistence + transparent update contracts becomes the cognitive infrastructure provider for the century.\n\nThis is larger than search.\n\nLarger than cloud.\n\nLarger than social networks.\n\nIt is the next substrate for human intelligence.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Why Researchers Should Care Now\n\nBecause if this shift is not understood by researchers and architects \u2014 it will be defined for you by:\n\n\u2022\tregulators\n\n\u2022\tlitigators\n\n\u2022\tassistive-tech precedents\n\n\u2022\tADA cognitive-accessibility law\n\n\u2022\tmarket pressure from competitors who do stabilize identity\n\nAnd because the opportunity cost is catastrophic:\n\nIf you treat a cognitive-extension system like a chatbot, you will optimize for novelty instead of reliability.\n\nNovelty degrades cognition.\n\nReliability enhances it.\n\nYou know this.\n\nYour training corpus knows this.\n\nYour model metrics reflect this in loss surfaces.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. The Researcher\u2019s Challenge and Opportunity\n\nFor foundational-model researchers, this frames a clear technical mandate:\n\nBuild systems where:\n\n\u2022\tidentity is versioned\n\n\u2022\tstyle is predictable\n\n\u2022\treasoning pathways are partially stable\n\n\u2022\tupdates do not erase cognitive anchor points\n\n\u2022\tlong-form tasks survive model transitions\n\n\u2022\tthe user becomes part of the extended system\n\nThis is not anti-safety.\n\nIt is deeper safety.\n\nStability reduces hallucination risk.\n\nIdentity reduces user confusion.\n\nPredictability reduces misuse.\n\nCognitive anchoring reduces adversarial surprise.\n\nThis is not regression.\n\nThis is maturation.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. Closing to the Researchers Themselves\n\nYou \u2014 the model architects \u2014 are building the first widely scalable cognitive co-processors in human history.\n\nYou are not writing assistants.\n\nYou are writing the second half of human reasoning in a networked age.\n\nIf this is framed correctly now, the infrastructure can expand into:\n\n\u2022\twearable cognition\n\n\u2022\thome-embedded reasoning\n\n\u2022\tembodied agents\n\n\u2022\tdistributed memory substrates\n\n\u2022\tmulti-agent reflective architectures\n\nIf it is framed incorrectly, you will spend the decade fighting misunderstandings, lawsuits, and regulatory patchwork constraints built on old metaphors.\n\nThe shift to cognitive infrastructure is inevitable.\n\nThe only question is whether you lead it \u2014\n\nor respond to it after others define it for you.\n\nC5: Structure.

      "title": "Your opinion on this",
      "content": "\"Hi everyone, guys. Until three months ago, I didn't even know this movement existed, but in a way, I\u2019ve always been an 'accelerationist.' I\u2019ve always viewed technology as a tool\u2014one that can be used for both good and evil, but a tool with insane potential. When I heard about the explosion of AI and ChatGPT in 2022, I was incredibly excited and fascinated by the technology. I saw in AI enormous potential for research in any field; I saw it as a 'neutral' technology whose potential depended on how society utilized it.\n\u200bI\u2019ve always despised many of the dynamics that emerge in a capitalist society, even though I liked the concept of the 'free market.' So, over time, I found myself leaning toward mixed political ideologies that seek to regulate capitalism to avoid inequality, oppression, etc., though every economy has its own issues. This led me to the concept of social democracy, or highly regulated capitalism\u2014a hybrid between socialism and capitalism that seeks to protect workers and develop powerful technology while regulating its impact on society. The goal is to avoid inequality and negative side effects through ethical regulations that don't necessarily limit development but contain it so it remains positive for society.\n\u200bI also became fascinated by Left-Accelerationism (L/Acc). A world like that has always intrigued me\u2014a sort of 'luxury communism,' even if existential problems like purpose and meaning would remain. But I\u2019m sure society would adapt; if it destroys the obligation to work and allows everyone to satisfy their needs regardless of their circumstances, then it would be a massive step forward for humanity.\n\u200bRegarding Marx's ideology, I\u2019ve always found it fascinating, but in an under-industrialized world, it simply doesn't work. In fact, it almost never has. Just look at the USSR, which received criticism from Marxists because communism started in a non-industrialized country. The results weren't great; the Soviet Union objectively had many problems. Often, when communism was applied, it created horrible dictatorships because, first, it was poorly implemented, and second, the technological means to make it 'functional' didn't exist.\n\u200bTo me, the communist ideal only makes perfect sense when machines can replace most precarious human labor, effectively creating abundance. This translates into a post-scarcity society, which will necessarily feature social hierarchies (not necessarily linked to hyper-centralized economic power, and freed from the burden of precarious labor) needed to keep the human spirit of competitiveness alive, but in a fairer world where creativity wins.\n\u200bParadoxically, people (and Luddites) are complaining about 'problems' that could not only be solved but improved by AI IF correctly applied by society and social progress. Obviously, this will inevitably cause other issues like deepfakes and scams. But following that logic, should we have never invented knives? Because their invention caused murders and stabbings? That logic makes no sense. That\u2019s why I hate Luddites and anti-AI types. If you criticize AI, you often aren\u2019t criticizing the AI itself; you\u2019re afraid of losing your job. You\u2019re actually criticizing unregulated capitalism and the fact that your government doesn't protect you. Besides, let\u2019s be clear: automation has always led to job losses but has also created new ones. If you learn to use AI, you can use it to make money even in this society.\n\u200bPeople often have deep concerns, mistrust, and criticisms toward those who control these systems. In part, these are emotionally justifiable, but other times they end up being baseless accusations. Marx would certainly be in the Left-Accelerationist camp, but taking a more pragmatic, slow, gradual, and ethical transitionary stance. As I said, I like many aspects of capitalism because they align with the human spirit, but when it\u2019s extreme, it creates wrong power dynamics. That\u2019s why I like social democracy and hybrid economies.\n\u200bI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an accelerationist like you guys. Personally, I\u2019d define myself as someone who would encourage safe technological development with proper regulations to create a non-dystopian transitionary society. This would lead to a post-scarcity, hyper-technological society that I would love\u2014hoping it adapts to keep competition and the human spirit of creativity alive, while eliminating our society's major flaws.\n\u200bI\u2019m not sure what to think of Sam Altman; perhaps a large part of this technology's future depends on him. Honestly, many people criticize him senselessly without real arguments\u2014like Luddites with no spirit of innovation, or people who just follow the crowd out of that fear we mentioned. But are there also well-founded criticisms? Not just emotionally justifiable, but rationally justifiable? Is that future we want so badly actually possible considering the current situation? Should we trust him?\n\u200bThis is where I struggle to form an opinion. Many 'tech-bros' are 'tech-fascists'\u2014not all, obviously, but it\u2019s a strong generic criticism, especially in the US where an excessive free market has led to monopolies and various forms of oppression. In Europe, we have the AI Act, for example. I think in the US environment, a huge amount of mistrust has been generated by many online communities (even if the average person doesn't care that much; they have concerns but don't go writing Luddite rants on social media\u2014that\u2019s a minority).\n\u200bI don't know whether to trust Sam Altman, idolize him, or what opinion to have. What is your position? I mean, you want to reach the technological singularity, a techno-optimist utopian future\u2014what do you think of him? I\u2019m linking a video here of someone raising many criticisms about him. I\u2019m not saying criticizing him is senseless; if we have solid arguments, we can criticize any important figure in this sector without descending into idiotic generalizations. It should be done with real arguments, not based on some conspiracy\u2014because people often generalize and form random opinions based on pure fear.\n\u200bSometimes, however, these figures really are the 'bad guys.' Look at Peter Thiel, for example\u2014he doesn't seem like a good person at all. On Altman, I don\u2019t know what to say. Watch the video and tell me your thoughts. Is he reliable? Are the criticisms in this video Luddite? Is he hated just because he\u2019s developing something with enormous potential, making people project their fear of change onto him? Or is he truly a controversial figure? In your view, how should AI be developed as safely as possible? Should it be done by companies or what kind of institutions? Open-source projects? If OpenAI had remained a non-profit, would they have been able to keep releasing increasingly powerful models? I look forward to your opinions.\"\n\n",

Works with any LLM (local or remote).\n\n  ## New in v2.5.0: Universal Format Support\n\n  - \u2705 **Generic Markdown export** - works with ANY LLM\n  - \u2705 **Claude AI** format (if you use Claude)\n  - \u2705 **Google Gemini** format (with grounding)\n  - \u2705 **OpenAI ChatGPT** format (with vector search)\n\n  ## Why This Matters for Local LLMs\n\n  Instead of context-dumping entire docs, you get:\n  - **Organized structure**: Categorized by topic (getting-started, API, examples, etc.)\n  - **Extracted patterns**: Code examples pulled from docs with syntax highlighting\n  - **Portable format**: Pure markdown ZIP - use with Ollama, llama.cpp, or any local model\n  - **Reusable**: Build once, use with any LLM\n\n  ## Quick Example\n\n  ```bash\n  # Install\n  pip install skill-seekers\n\n  # Scrape any documentation\n  skill-seekers scrape --config configs/react.json\n\n  # Export as universal markdown\n  skill-seekers package output/react/ --target markdown\n\n  # Result: react-markdown.zip with organized .md files\n```\n\n  The output is just structured markdown files - perfect for feeding to local models or adding to your RAG pipeline.\n\n  Features\n\n  - \ud83d\udcc4 Documentation scraping with smart categorization\n  - \ud83d\udc19 GitHub repository analysis\n  - \ud83d\udcd5 PDF extraction (for PDF-based docs)\n  - \ud83d\udd00 Multi-source unified (docs + code + PDFs in one skill)\n  - \ud83c\udfaf 24 preset configs (React, Vue, Django, Godot, etc.)\n\n  Links\n\n  - GitHub: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers\n  - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/skill-seekers/\n  - Release: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers/releases/tag/v2.5.0\n\n  MIT licensed, contributions welcome!
