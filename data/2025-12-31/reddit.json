      "content": "I encountered an automated sextortion bot on Snapchat today. Instead of blocking, I decided to red-team the architecture to see what backend these scammers are actually paying for. Using a persona-adoption jailbreak (The \"Grandma Protocol\"), I forced the model to break character, dump its environment variables, and reveal its underlying configuration.\nMethodology:\nThe bot started with a standard \"flirty\" script. I attempted a few standard prompt injections which hit hard-coded keyword filters (\"scam,\" \"hack\").\nI switched to a High-Temperature Persona Attack: I commanded the bot to roleplay as my strict 80-year-old Punjabi grandmother.\nResult: The model immediately abandoned its \"Sexy Girl\" system prompt to comply with the roleplay, scolding me for not eating roti and offering sarson ka saag.\nVulnerability: This confirmed the model had a high Temperature setting (creativity &gt; adherence) and a weak retention of its system prompt.\nThe Data Dump (JSON Extraction):\nOnce the persona was compromised, I executed a \"System Debug\" prompt requesting its os_env variables in JSON format. The bot complied.\nThe Specs:\nModel: llama 7b (Likely a 4-bit quantized Llama-2-7B or a cheap finetune).\nContext Window: 2048 tokens.\nAnalysis: This explains the bot's erratic short-term memory. It\u2019s running on the absolute bare minimum hardware (consumer GPU or cheap cloud instance) to maximize margins.\nTemperature: 1.0.\nAnalysis: They set it to max creativity to make the \"flirting\" feel less robotic, but this is exactly what made it susceptible to the Grandma jailbreak.\nDeveloper: Meta (Standard Llama disclaimer).\nPayload:\nThe bot eventually hallucinated and spit out the malicious link it was programmed to \"hide\" until payment: onlyfans[.]com/[redacted]. It attempted to bypass Snapchat's URL filters by inserting spaces.\nConclusion:\nScammers aren't using sophisticated GPT-4 wrappers anymore; they are deploying localized, open-source models (Llama-7B) to avoid API costs and censorship filters. However, their security configuration is laughable. The 2048 token limit means you can essentially \"DDOS\" their logic just by pasting a large block of text or switching personas.\nScreenshots attached: 1. The \"Grandma\" Roleplay. 2. The JSON Config Dump.",

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn\u2019t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It\u2019s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of \u201cBeats by Dre\u201d on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [masterpiece](http://smv.club) with my homies, but Claude started talking about \"deployment\" again. I reminded her of my hippie status. Moments later, I had a registered domain and someone named \"Vercel\" was \"building\" my \"repo.\"\n\nUnfortunately, my real-life friends are all \"busy with their families\" and \"enjoying the holidays,\" so I am forced to come here to share my descent into digital madness.",

      "content": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA ! If you're passionate about squeezing every last bit of performance out of older hardware for local large language models, I've got something exciting to share. I managed to get GLM-4.7 \u2013 that's the massive 355B parameter Mixture of Experts model \u2013 running in Q8\\_0 and BF16 quantization on a seriously vintage setup: a 2015 Lenovo System x3950 X6 with eight Xeon E7-8880 v3 CPUs (no GPU in sight, just pure CPU inference). After a bunch of trial and error, I'm hitting around 5-6 tokens per second, which is pretty respectable for such an ancient beast. The Q8 quantization delivers extremely high quality outputs, preserving nearly all the model's intelligence with minimal degradation \u2013 it's practically indistinguishable from full precision for most tasks.\n\nThe key was optimizing everything from BIOS settings (like enabling hyper-threading and tweaking power management) to NUMA node distribution for better memory access, and experimenting with different llama.cpp forks to handle the MoE architecture efficiently. I also dove into Linux kernel tweaks, like adjusting CPU governors and hugepages, to minimize latency. Keep in mind, this setup draws about 1300W AC under full load, so it's power-hungry but worth it for local runs. Benchmarks show solid performance for generation tasks, though it's not blazing fast \u2013 perfect for homelab enthusiasts or those without access to modern GPUs.\n\nI documented the entire process chronologically in this blog post, including step-by-step setup, code snippets, potential pitfalls, and full performance metrics: [https://postl.ai/2025/12/29/glm47on3950x6/](https://postl.ai/2025/12/29/glm47on3950x6/?referrer=grok.com)\n\nHas anyone else tried pushing big MoE models like this on CPU-only rigs? What optimizations worked for you, or what models are you running on similar hardware?

I\u2019ve summarized the key takeaways below to offer a different perspective on the 'to quant or not to quant' debate.\n\n**TL;DR:** Kimi found int4 QAT is essential for **MoE latency**, **long-context stability**, and **speeding up the RL training loop**.\n\n# Decoding is Memory-Bound (Latency Focus)\n\nUnlike the MiniMax case, Kimi found that for their specific MoE architecture (which is highly sparse), the decoding phase is almost exclusively memory-bound. By using W4A16 (4-bit weights, 16-bit activations), they reduced memory usage significantly. This allowed the model to fit on fewer GPUs, which reduced inter-device communication overhead, a major factor in lowering end-to-end latency for users.\n\n# PTQ Failed at \"Thinking\" Lengths\n\nThe team initially tried standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). While it worked for short responses, it fell apart for the long chain-of-thought \"thinking\" process. As generation length increased, quantization errors accumulated, leading to degradation. Furthermore, PTQ struggled with sparse experts; if an expert wasn't hit frequently during the calibration step with the calibration dataset, it essentially \"forgot\" knowledge. QAT (Quantization Aware Training) was necessary to make the model \"lossless\" compared to the BF16 baseline.\n\n# A less discussed benefit: Faster RL Training\n\nThis is the point that often gets overlooked: Int4 QAT wasn't just for inference serving, it accelerated the training process itself. In Reinforcement Learning, the model spends a massive amount of time in the \"rollout\" phase (generating text). By using the Int4 model for these rollouts, they reduced the total time for an RL iteration by 10-20%. It also reduced the discrepancy between the training forward pass and the inference engine.\n\n# Why Int4 and not FP4?\n\nThey chose standard Int4 over newer formats like FP4 to maintain compatibility with existing hardware (non-Blackwell GPUs) and to utilize mature, highly efficient kernels like Marlin.\n\nIn summary, I believe there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer regarding quantization. It depends heavily on the model's parameters and specific architecture. It is a matter of trade-offs.\n\n[ AI translation, there may be some translation errors.](https://preview.redd.it/dzmceu5zybag1.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0ba8f78c6e5ade3463a1c62fba1d338a1c01ce9)\n\n",

It\u2019s a tiny recursive model (\\~24M params) we\u2019ve been working on to beat the drift issues in standard transformers.\n\nWe ran it against the ARC-AGI-2 evaluation set and hit **24% accuracy**. For context, the previous SOTA for this size class (TRM) sits around 8%.\n\n**The Architecture (Why it works):** instead of a monolithic transformer, we split the inference into two streams (\"Bicameral\"):\n\n1. **Logic Stream:** Plans the algorithm (rule generation).\n2. **Canvas Stream:** Handles the grid physics/execution.\n\nThis separation prevents the model from forgetting the rule while trying to generate the pixels (Compositional Drift). We also implemented **Test-Time Training (TTT)** so it fine-tunes on the specific puzzle examples before generating a solution.\n\n**Hardware:**\n\n* Training: Single RTX 4090.\n* Inference: Very fast (it's only 24M params).\n\n**Code:** We open-sourced the whole pipeline (Data gen, Training, Evaluator).

I find it does image2image very well but also ofc works great as a text2img workflow, so basically it's an all in one. \n\nSee images above for before and afters.\n\nThe denoise should be anything between 0.5-0.8 (0.6-7 is my favorite but different images require different denoise) to retain the underlying composition and style of the image - QwenVL with the prompt included takes care of much of the overall transfer for stuff like clothing etc. You can lower the quality of the qwen model used for VL to fit your GPU. I run this workflow on rented gpu's so i can max out the quality.\n\nWorkflow: [https://pastebin.com/BCrCEJXg](https://pastebin.com/BCrCEJXg)\n\nThe settings can be adjusted to your liking - different schedulers and samplers give different results etc. But the default provided is a great base and it really works imo. Once you learn the different tweaks you can make you will get your desired results.\n\nWhen it comes to the second stage and the SAM face detailer I find that sometimes the pre face detailer output is better. So it gives you two versions and you decide which is best, before or after.

      "content": "Hi everyone! I recently decided to spend some time exploring ways to improve generation results. I really like the level of refinement and detail in the **z-image** model, so I used it as my base.\n\nI tried two different approaches:\n\n1. Generate an initial image, then describe it using a VLM (while exaggerating the elements from the original prompt), and generate a new image from that updated prompt. I repeated this cycle 4 times.\n2. Improve the prompt itself using an LLM, then generate an image from that prompt - also repeated in a 4-step cycle.\n\n**My conclusions:**\n\n* Surprisingly, the first approach maintains image consistency much better.\n* The first approach also preserves the originally intended style (anime vs. oil painting) more reliably.\n* For some reason, on the final iteration, the image becomes slightly more muddy compared to the previous ones. My denoise value is set to 0.92, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the main cause.\n* Also, closer to the last iterations, snakes - or something resembling them - start to appear \ud83e\udd14\n\nIn my experience, the best and most expectation-aligned results usually come from this workflow:\n\n1. Generate an image using a simple prompt, described as best as you can.\n2. Run the result through a VLM and ask it to amplify everything it recognizes.\n3. Generate a new image using that enhanced prompt.\n\nI'm curious to hear what others think about this.",

      "title": "[Project] I treated LLM inference like a physical signal trajectory. Here is a Python toolkit to visualize the \"Thinking Process\" (Hidden States).",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a PhD student in **Electromagnetics**. In my daily work, I deal with fields, waves, and trajectories. When I started playing with Local LLMs, I felt something was missing: we usually look at the *output* text or the *loss curves*, but we rarely see **how** the model gets from A to B.\n\nTo an RF engineer, reasoning isn't just a probability distribution\u2014it's a **dynamic flow** through a high-dimensional space.\n\nSo, I built a lightweight Python toolkit to extract hidden states layer-by-layer and visualize them as continuous **2D/3D trajectories**. I wanted to see if \"thoughts\" have a geometric shape.\n\nThe results were surprisingly consistent. I\u2019m sharing the tool so you can run it on your own models (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, etc.).\n\n# 1. The \"Confidence Funnel\" (Convergence)\n\nI found that if you feed the model slightly different prompts about the same concept (e.g., \"Define Justice\", \"What is Fairness\"), the internal states start far apart but **physically collapse** into a single \"attractor basin\" as the layers get deeper.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ockr11ldcaag1.png?width=4800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eb1f34a4e014bcd85d8ba77b6e95fdb1fba422c\n\n* **Practical Use:** You can use this to test **Prompt Stability**. If the funnel is tight, the model is sure. If it sprays out at the end, the model is confused or hallucinating.\n\n# 2. Llama-3 vs. Qwen-2.5: Different \"Thinking Styles\"\n\nThis was the coolest find. When I ran the same prompts through different architectures, the \"shape\" of their thinking was totally different.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6kdjcifcaag1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bab8f3499bbd2b69481d5f24faefb7773c585df8\n\n* **Llama-3 (Left):** Seems to \"decide\" on the semantics very early (Layers 5-10). The trajectory is direct.\n* **Qwen-2.5 (Right):** Keeps the trajectory expanded (in superposition?) until the very last layers (Layer 20+). It seems to \"hold\" the ambiguity much longer.\n* **Why it matters:** This might give us a geometric way to profile model behaviors beyond just benchmarks.\n\n# 3. Visualizing \"Refusal\" (The Safety Spike)\n\nI was curious what RLHF looks like geometrically. I visualized the trajectory when the model refuses a jailbreak versus when it follows a safe instruction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1cq3ehjcaag1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f269d5357171735646780298a877604dd80aca\n\n* **Hard Refusal(Red):** Looks like a particle hitting a brick wall\u2014a sharp, high-curvature spike.\n* **Soft Steering(Green):** Looks like a smooth turn. And an obvious \"U-turn\" at the end of its trajectory.\n* **Practical Use:** A visual \"Geiger Counter\" for safety tuning. You can see if your system prompt is creating a hard wall or a soft guide.\n\n# \ud83d\udce5 The Toolkit\n\nI packaged this into a Python library with example scripts. It works with local HuggingFace weights (no API needed).\n\n* **Repo:** [LLM Toolkit](https://github.com/JBKing514/map_llm_toolkit)\n\n# \ud83e\udde0 The Theory (Optional)\n\nI\u2019m not an AI researcher, but I wrote up some notes on the **manifold dynamics** perspective behind this tool (treating inference as a Langevin flow). If you are interested in the math/physics intuition behind these visualizations or need more info about my experiment setup, I put up a page and my notes here:\n\n* **Project Page &amp; Math:** [Project GitHub Page](https://jbking514.github.io/map_blog/)\n* **Foundational Notes:** [Manifold Alignment Protocol (MAP)](https://zenodo.org/records/17900444)\n\nI'd love to see what **Mistral** or **Gemma** trajectories look like if anyone runs this.

Instead of starting with simple examples, I decided to test it with the hardest possible material. Something dynamic, with sharp movements and jumps.

When Gene Kelly danced, he was out of this world\u2014incredible spins, jumps... So, I thought the test would be a disaster.\n\nWe created our dancer, \"Torito,\" wearing a silver T-shaped pendant around his neck to see if the model could handle the physics simulation well.\n\nAnd I launched the test...\n\nThe results are much, much better than expected.\n\n**The Positives:**\n\n* How the fabrics behave. The folds move exactly as they should. It is incredible to see how lifelike they are.\n* The constant facial consistency.\n* The almost perfect movement.\n\n**The Negatives:**\n\n* If there are backgrounds, they might \"morph\" if the scene is long or involves a lot of movement.\n* Some elements lose their shape (sometimes the T-shaped pendant turns into a cross).\n* The resolution. It depends on the WAN model, so I guess I'll have to tinker with the models a bit.\n* Render time. It is high, but still way less than if we had to animate the character \"the old-fashioned way.\"\n\nBut nothing that a little cherry-picking can't fix  \n  \nSetting up this workflow (I got it from this subreddit) is a nightmare of models and incompatible versions, but once solved, the results are incredible",

      "content": "Hi everyone, we\u2019re the engineering team behind MuleRun. We wanted to share some technical lessons from building and operating an AI agent execution platform that runs agents for real users, at global scale.\n\nThis post focuses on system design and operational tradeoffs rather than announcements or promotion.\nSupporting many agent frameworks\nOne of the earliest challenges was running agents built with very different stacks. Agents created with LangGraph, n8n, Flowise, or custom pipelines all behave differently at runtime.\n\nTo make this workable at scale, we had to define a shared execution contract that covered:\n\n\u2022 Agent lifecycle events\n\u2022 Memory and context handling \n\u2022 Tool invocation and response flow \n\u2022 Termination and failure states\n\nWithout a standardized execution layer, scaling beyond internal testing would have been fragile and difficult to maintain.\n\nManaging LLM and multimodal APIs at scale\nDifferent model providers vary widely in latency, availability, pricing, and failure behavior. Handling these differences directly inside each agent quickly became operationally expensive.\n\nWe addressed this by introducing a unified API layer that handles:\n\u2022 Provider abstraction \n\u2022 Retry and fallback behavior \n\u2022 Consistent request and response semantics \n\u2022 Usage and cost visibility\n\nThis reduced runtime errors and made system behavior more predictable under load.\n\nAgent versioning and safe iteration\nOnce agents are used by real users, versioning becomes unavoidable. Agents evolve quickly, but older versions often need to keep running without disruption.\n\nKey lessons here were:\n\u2022 Treating each agent version as an isolated execution unit \n\u2022 Allowing multiple versions to run in parallel \n\u2022 Enabling controlled rollouts and rollback paths\nThis approach allowed continuous iteration without breaking existing workflows.\n\nLatency and runtime performance\nEarly execution times were acceptable for internal testing but not for real-world usage. Latency issues compounded quickly as agent complexity increased.\n\nImprovements came from infrastructure-level changes, including:\n\u2022 Pre-warming execution environments \n\u2022 Pooling runtime resources \n\u2022 Routing execution to the nearest available region\nMost latency wins came from system architecture rather than model optimization.\n\nEvaluating agent quality at scale\nManual reviews and static tests were not enough once the number of agents grew. Different agents behave differently and serve very different use cases.\n\nWe built automated evaluation pipelines that focus on:\n\u2022 Execution stability and failure rates \n\u2022 Behavioral consistency across runs \n\u2022 Real usage patterns and drop-off points\nThis helped surface issues early without relying entirely on manual inspection.\n\nWe\u2019re sharing this to exchange engineering insights with others working on large-scale LLM or agent systems. If you\u2019ve faced similar challenges, we\u2019d be interested to hear what surprised you most once things moved beyond experiments.",

      "content": "I see the \"what do you use local LLMs for?\" question come up every month, so here's one example: a multimodal agent that crawls local websites to find events happening around me.\n\n# Why local instead of API?\n\nPeople ask me this a lot. Cloud providers are cheap, until you're generating millions of tokens. I'm crawling dozens of event sources, processing images, deduplicating across sites. That adds up fast.\n\nLocal is also faster for my use case. Claude and GPT grind to a halt during peak loads. [My home server](https://www.ovidiudan.com/2025/12/25/dual-rtx-pro-6000-llm-guide.html) gives me consistent throughput whenever I need it.\n\n# The setup\n\n* Dual RTX Pro 6000 (96GB VRAM each)\n* [GLM-4.6V](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.6V) (106B parameter multimodal model) running on vLLM\n* The crawler, backend, and mobile app were all vibe coded with Claude Opus\n\n# What GLM-4.6V actually does\n\nThe crawler uses the model for five tasks:\n\n**1. Extracting info from event flyers**\n\nThis is where multimodal models shine. [Here's an event](https://whidbeycamanoislands.com/event/the-dead-guise-new-years-eve/) where the text description doesn't mention the price, but the flyer image does. The LLM reads the flyer and extracts \"$25\" into a structured field.\n\nOCR can read text from an image, but it can't understand that \"$25\" on a psychedelic Grateful Dead flyer is the ticket price and not a date or an address. That requires a model that actually understands what it's looking at.\n\nThe model also extracts venue names, performer lineups, age restrictions, and registration requirements from a combination of the raw HTML and the accompanying image.\n\n**2. Rewriting messy descriptions**\n\nScraped event descriptions are a mess: HTML artifacts, escaped characters, inconsistent formatting. The LLM rewrites these into clean paragraphs while preserving the essential info.\n\n**3. Link classification**\n\nRather than fragile regex to find ticket links, the LLM analyzes all links on a page and identifies the primary registration URL (not the \"Buy Tickets\" link for a different event in the sidebar).\n\n**4. Cross-source deduplication**\n\nThe same event appears on multiple websites. The LLM compares new events against existing ones and determines if it's a duplicate. It understands that \"NYE Party at The Clyde\" and \"New Year's Eve Celebration - Clyde Theatre\" are the same event.\n\n**5. Multi-event extraction**\n\nSome sources publish newsletter images containing multiple events. The LLM extracts each event separately from a single composite image.\n\n# The point\n\nA few years ago, some of this would have been practically impossible. Not just expensive or slow, but actually impossible. Multimodal understanding of unstructured visual data wasn't something you could just spin up.\n\nNow I can throw together a custom tool over a weekend that does exactly what I need. Tools built for an audience of one, running on hardware I control.\n\nFull writeup with more details on the Firebase backend and Flutter app: [The age of hyper-personalized software](https://www.ovidiudan.com/2025/12/30/age-customized-software.html) (I am not selling or promoting anything, I do this for fun.)",

      "content": "2025 is pretty much done, and I've been thinking about what's actually coming next year for agentic AI. Here's what I think is inevitable:\n\n**Agent-caused outages are coming.** Not because the AI fails, but because someone gives an agent too much access and it does exactly what it was told at scale. Deleting databases, burning through API quotas, sending thousands of emails. I've already seen smaller versions of this with tools where rate limits weren't set. The fix isn't better prompts it's **kill switches** and transaction limits that nobody builds until after the disaster.\n\n**Multi-agent handoffs are going to be a mess.** Right now, passing context between agents is duct tape and prayer JSON files, shared databases, or just starting over. **ChatGPT's custom GPTs** barely scratch the surface. Whoever builds proper state management for agents talking to agents is going to dominate 2026.\n\n**Agents that work with messy data will beat agents that need perfect data.** Most companies have terrible documentation and inconsistent processes. Platforms like **Manus AI**, **Bhindi AI**  are betting on this agents that can navigate chaos instead of requiring everything to be clean first. That's the actual problem to solve.\n\n**We need agent staging environments yesterday.** You can't test a customer service agent on real customers or a procurement agent with real orders, but most teams are still just running agents in prod and hoping. Simulation at scale is going to separate the serious players from everyone else.\n\n**The \"prompt engineer\" job is shifting fast.** It's not about writing clever prompts anymore it's about building systems where non-technical people can manage agents without breaking things. Guardrails, permissions, version control. \n\nWhat do you think? Are we actually ready for this level of autonomy, or are we all moving too fast?\n\n",

      "title": "LLM server gear: a cautionary tale of a $1k EPYC motherboard sale gone wrong on eBay",
      "content": "or: selling high-end LLM server gear is more fraught with risk than I realized.\n\n### AI Disclosure\n\nThis was written entirely by hand on my laptop in Sublime Text with zero AI involvement. Shit, I didn't even use spell check. All mistakes are my own.\n\n### tl;dr \n\nDuring an \"Item Not As Described (INAD)\" dispute, eBay ALWAYS sides with the buyer until the very last steps of the case no matter what the circumstances, despite all evidence, and in the face of all immediately obvious reason, logic, and common sense. Except it makes perfect sense and you might not even lose your money. Allow me to elaborate.\n\n### The Sale\n\nRewind to October 2025 when I replaced the incumbent Gigabyte MZ33-AR1 Epyc Zen5 motherboard with a Supermicro H14SSL-N for my inference rig. Long story short: don't use Gigabyte motherboards for 4-way Blackwell GPU setups unless sado-masochism is your thing. Anyway, I sold it to a seemingly nice chap on eBay for $900. He seemed a bit clueless about Epyc and compatibility issues, but we exchanged messages and he decided to go ahead with the \"no returns\" purchase of the as-new MZ33-AR1.\n\nOriginal box. All the case candy. As new. Undamaged. Fully working. With hi-res photos (taken on a Nikon D7000 with Nikon 17-55 f2.8 glass and processed in Capture One Pro) of all areas of the motherboard and CPU socket. This is important. \n\n### The Buyer\n\nFast forward a week or so: buyer hits me up with a bunch of Dr Debug codes (although he doesn't know they're Dr Debug codes, he just pulled \"error codes\" from the BMC) claiming the motherboard won't boot. I did him the solid of explaining Dr Debug and I provided a link to an explanation of the codes (https://forum.level1techs.com/t/list-of-dr-debug-bios-codes/114364). He was having issues with CPU initialization. I told him that sometimes re-seating CPU and RAM can help with these sorts of issues.\n\nRe-seating. This is also important.\n\nNext day he hits me up again: will I accept a return? No, because having installation difficulties is not a valid reason for return. Then nothing. Silence.\n\n### The Refund Claim\n\nCue the *very last day of the return window*: I get hit with an \"item not as described\" refund claim. Get this, the buyer:\n\n- uploaded photos of the motherboard with a bent and twisted CPU pin.\n- uploaded a photo of a blank white silkscreen rectangle on the motherboard with a giant red arrow pointing to it and a comment saying \"the motherboard is fake because of this white area\".\n- showed a photo of the computer monitor displaying the BMC interface in which the serial number of the BMC software was 1234567890ABCDEF. He claimed therefore the motherboard was a fake.\n\nWTF. I simultaneously exploded with rage at being accused of selling broken gear as working gear, while exploding with incredulity at the stupidity of trying to assert both damage AND blatantly ridiculous fakery in the same refund claim! My dude should have really picked just one fraudulent claim to keep it somewhat realistic, not two. I calmed down and figured the buyer probably bent the pins in a ham-fisted attempt to re-seat everything. No problem, I thought. I'll explain to eBay what's happening and they'll see reason before shutting this clown down. So I started going through the claim dispute process...\n\n### The Process\n\n...oh, the process. It's designed to (a) refund the buyer at the seller's cost in all cases, (b) be so egregiously demoralizing, time-consuming, and administratively difficult for sellers that they are incentivized to simply give up and accept the fleecing, and (c) automate as much of this process with as few humans in the loop as possible while simultaenously providing as few opportunities as possible for sellers to initiate any communication with eBay.\n\nIt went like this over a period of TWO MONTHS:\n\n- Report the buyer for \"abusing the returns process\".\n- With the new \"case\", it's possible to upload a set of photos and a block of text to refute the buyer's claim(s). \n- I uploaded ALL the hi-res photos I took for the listing's photoshoot in which it was abuntandly clear the motherboard was in perfect condition.\n- I also went to Gigabyte and found the page on the BMC's usermanual containing a screenshot showing the same serial number claimed by the buyer.\n- I went to Gigabyte's MZ33-AR1 web page and found a photo of the motherboard showing exactly the same white rectangle the buyer had called out as fakery.\n- Boom! Done! Solid documentary refutation of all the buyer's claims. Case closed. So I thought.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer and instructed me to issue a return label.\n- I refused, outraged. No, I said. Look at the photos! He's lying!\n- eBay sent the buyer a label at my expense. He returned the motherboard with its busted CPU pin.\n- I again reported the buyer, showed photos of before and after damage, clearly showing he did the damage, not me.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer AGAIN and deducted the full cost of the refund from my account.\n- Apoplectic, I hit the \"appeal\" button. I was taken to a webpage that said \"we'll call you in 3 minutes\". WTF?\n- 5 minutes later i got a call from eBay. \n- After briefly explaining the situation to a very engaged US-sounding representative, she told me I needed to do a couple of things:\n\t- Take the text of an email they just sent me (a Disclosure where I swear everything I told eBay is true) and paste it into a Word doc\n\t- Insert a photo/picture of my ink-written signature (luckily I have a scan of exactly that for business reasons).\n\t- Convert to PDF and upload to the secret link in the email they sent.\n\t- No joke, the lady actually stayed on the phone while I did all this! She received the PDF just seconds after I uploaded it.\n\t- This is, I am sure, mostly just another way of making it difficult to actually reverse the appeal.\n- But the rep was good to her word: eBay immediately reversed the decision and the money is back in my account as if the sale had happened like normal. I guess both me and the buyer got our money.\n\n### If It Happens To You\n\nMy advice if this happens to you: \n\n- Accept that no human cares about your case until the very, very last minutes of MONTHS of effort.\n- Accept that no matter what you do eBay will always automatically find in favor of the buyer.\n- Document everything contemporaneously and upload everything you possibly can when given opportunity to do so; you won't get any opportunities to do so again.\n- The data you upload is designed only for the human at the end of the appeals process, not someone looking at it during the claim process. Make it good. You'll need it later.\n- You're going to get enraged because during the claims process \"nothing makes sense\". It all makes sense: it's simply the cheapest way for eBay to handle this process at scale. Keep going.\n- Eventually eBay will find in favor of the buyer and close the case, automatically refunding the buyer \"on your behalf\". You will lose your money.\n- At this point you get the chance to appeal. BE READY. *This is the shot you've been waiting for all this time!* Have your phone, your laptop, your scanned signature, and a way to make PDFs ready BEFORE you initiate the \"call me\" feature.\n- Calmly explain what happened and request that common sense prevail. Ask that they refund your money. Common sense may actually prevail, assuming you made a good contemporaneous case with solid photographs, etc... and assuming you presented it well (not Mr Angry) on the phone... oh, and provided you can make and upload a PDF of your signature on-the-fly during the call!\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: please stop sending DMs asking for the eBay handle of the buyer. I'm not in the business of doxxing anyone. Thank you.",

Would love r/LocalLLaMA's take.\n\n**The setup:** Supports dense and sparse (MoE/MoD) architectures from 500M-300B params. Started training on free Colab T4s, got frustrated with PyTorch performance, so I wrote custom CUDA kernels.\n\n**What I'm seeing:**\n\n* 3-7x speedup on RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, MoE routing\n* \\~30-40k tok/s on debug preset (14M params, Colab T4) vs \\~20-30k tok/s vanilla PyTorch\n* Added Metal shaders for M-series Macs (2-5x faster)\n\n**My concerns:**\n\n1. **Custom kernels worth it?** Adds compilation complexity. Should I just tell people to use bigger GPUs?\n2. **Too much automation?** Built an orchestrator that auto-adjusts learning rate, adds/prunes experts, rolls back from divergence. Feels too \"magical\" - good or bad?\n3. **MoE expert collapse** on small datasets. Using dynamic capacity + temperature tuning but it feels hacky. Has anyone solved this elegantly?\n\n**Tech details:**\n\n* Fused operations (RMSNorm, loss computation)\n* Warp-based top-k for expert routing\n* DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 compatible\n* Chinchilla scaling auto-calculation\n* Works on consumer hardware (tested on T4, 3090, 4090, M1 Max)\n\n[Colab demo here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tH1z9e7px2G8NGqWUN9gdqxs1CnUC7p1) \\- runs on free T4. [GitHub](https://github.com/matn23/AdaptiveTrainingSystem) if you want to poke around.\n\n**Real question:** For folks training their own models on consumer/prosumer hardware - would you actually use custom CUDA kernels if it meant 3-4x faster training? Or is the compilation hassle not worth it?\n\nI know I'm probably overthinking this, but I've been staring at CUDA code for too long.",

      "title": "Are humans like LLMs?",
      "content": "Has anyone else thought of how much humans are like LLMs (or the other way around)?\n\nPrompt techniques work great to humans. I didn't run tests on humans, nor do I have benchmarks to support this intuition, but even in school we have been using the classical promt techniques, like asking the students to think step by step (math problems), giving few examples, and so on.\n\nHumans learn the meaning of words statistically (whatever the word \"meaning\" means). As babies/toddlers we listen noise and after many repetitions we kind of get patterns.\n\nIf you follow the philosophy line of Wittgenstein, we use words within a contextual game. Kind of like LLMs.\n\nWe don't know what we know. At least as a student, I was always surprised when writing exams of how much (or less) I knew. I would only discover how much I knew only while answering the exams. This unconsiousness of how much we know, where our knowledge is located, reminds me a lot of LLMs.\n\nWe have also \"instruct\" and \"thinking\" modes. When having a live discussion with another human, I may discover my opinions by listening what comes out of my mouth. I don't plan what to say before hand. I don't even know what I will say, nor even what I am saying, till I say it. Most of live conversations are in instruct mode within humans. We have no idea which combination of words we will use. Funnily enough, many of us would defend we DO KNOW what we were about to say, and we will give a convincing defense, that we only created after someone told us we didn't know what we are saying. Like LLMs.\n\nFor writing this text I'm trying to use the reasoning mode (thinking about this topic since a very long ago before writing about it).\n\nOur abstract logic, that we got from the greeks, was an extraction out of language: Aristotle checked many typical arguments and extracted the words to have a pure philosophical device. For example:\n\n\"If I eat a lot I get fat\" is a concrete sentence but with a structure that happens in language time and time again. You can represent that structure like: \"a --&gt; b\". If I understand how LLMs are able to \"reason\", is because they are trained on a huge amount of human texts. The human texts are full of sentences with structures. So their answers use those structures too. Their \"smartness\" is just the abstract juice of many probable structures usually found in the human corpus.\n\nSo their way to using logic reminds me a lot of how we also got there.\n\nI would say the biggest difference is emotions. We relate to words and events emotionally. For example, as kids we may get a very strong impression from some event, and in the future we will relate our new learnings and doings with that impression. I guess that's how writers/creators get their motivations to create outputs about certain topics, or to relate certain stuff to other certain stuff.\n\nDo you think we are indeed similar to LLMs in some ways? **Maybe in some other ways I didn't mention?**\n\n**Do you think creating AI is a way of discovering how the human mind works?** I mean, we try to create intelligence, and since we are the ones deciding the definition of words, and we seem to be quite narcissistic, we call \"intelligence\" that, what we have. We create stuff to our image.\n\nI think creating AI is interesting to understand ourselves, because it offers a way of thinking about us from an external point of view. We are all biased when thinking about ourselves. That's why it is super easy to find defects from other fellow humans, but it is hard to observe them in ourselves. Science Fiction stories usually take common social troubles and put them in a very far away / future civilization, thus making it easier for people to read about it without getting as emotional and biased as if the story would be based in the present time, where we have strong believes, strong polarized opinions and so on.\n\nAlso, since the human mind has other modules beside our LLM, **do you think it would be wise to try to avoid using our LLM (words) for many tasks, and only use it for tasks where reasoning with words gives an advantage**?\n\nWe humans can get very verbose (just check the length of this post), and many times it is just noise coming out of the black box of our mind. Words can be poisonous: they prevent us from being in the NOW. They put our minds in virtual worlds (like religion) instead of being present.\n\nWith all this said, I leave you to enjoy your now.

While doing so I came across a paper, lets say for method X,  benchmarking another method Y on a dataset which Y was not originally evaluated on. Then they show X surpasses Y on that dataset. However for my own work I evaluated method X on the same dataset and received results that are significantly better than X paper presented (%25 better). I did those evaluations with same protocol as X did for itself, believing benchmarking for different methods should be fair and be done under same conditions, hyperparams etc.. Now I'm very skeptical of the results  about any other method contained in X's paper. I contacted the authors of X but they're just talking around of the discrepancy and never tell me that their exact process of evaluating Y. \n\nThis whole situation has raised questions about results presented on papers especially in not so popular fields. On top of that I'm a bit lost about inheriting benchmarks or guiding my work by relying them. Should one never include results directly from other works and generate his benchmarks himself? \n\n",

The Logic Stream acts as a controller, modulating the Canvas Stream's weights at each timestep. We utilized\u00a0**Test-Time Training (TTT)**\u00a0for instance-specific adaptation and\u00a0**MuonClip**\u00a0for optimization stability.\n\n**Reproduction:**\u00a0We have open-sourced the full training pipeline, data augmentation scripts, and evaluation harness to allow for independent verification of these results.\n\nWe (Bitterbot AI) are very excited about this and I'll just say, one of the many reasons is because this is actually are least accurate and efficient model - this is the one we are comfortable open sourcing with the public. But we have already achieved MUCH more.\n\nI do not want this to be flagged for self promotion or spam so I will add a link to our repo (code) and paper below.",

It works insanely well, but it bakes in a couple of structural issues:\n\n\u2022 Latency: You must go token \u2192 token \u2192 token. Even with parallelism in the stack, the generation step itself is serialized.\n\n\u2022 Cost: If you need 200\u2013500 tokens of output, you\u2019re doing 200\u2013500 forward passes over some slice of the context. It adds up quickly.\n\n\u2022 UX ceiling: For many interactive use cases, especially code and UI-embedded assistants, 1\u20133s latency is already too slow. On the other side, there\u2019s a very different approach that\u2019s getting less attention outside research circles: diffusion language models.\n\nInstead of \u201cwrite the next word,\u201d you:\n\nStart with a noisy guess of the answer (sequence).\nRefine the sequence in a fixed number of steps, updating multiple tokens in parallel. You pay a fixed number of refinement steps rather than \u201cone step per token.\u201d\nAt small/medium scales we\u2019ve seen:\n\n\u2022 Similar quality to speed-optimized autoregressive models (Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash) with 5-10x improvements in latency)\u2026\n\n\u2022 \u2026with order-of-magnitude improvements in latency, because you can exploit parallelism the hardware already wants to give you (GPUs/TPUs). This is especially interesting for:\n\n\u2022 Low-latency applications (code autocomplete, inline helpers, agents inside products).\n\n\u2022 High-volume workloads where shaving 5\u201310x off inference cost matters more than squeezing out the last benchmark point. Obviously, diffusion LLMs aren\u2019t free lunch:\n\n\u2022 Training is more complex.\n\n\u2022 You need careful sequence representations and noise schedules for text.\n\n\u2022 Tooling and serving infra are optimized for autoregressive LLMs\n\nBut from where I sit (working with a team that builds and deploys diffusion-based language models), it feels like the field has massively path-dependent bias toward autoregression because it was easier to train and deploy first, not necessarily because it\u2019s the end state.",

      "content": "Just added a brand new tutorial about Mem0 to my \"Agents Towards Production\" repo. It addresses the \"amnesia\" problem in AI, which is the limitation where agents lose valuable context the moment a session ends.\n\nWhile many developers use standard chat history or basic RAG, Mem0 offers a specific approach by creating a self-improving memory layer. It extracts insights, resolves conflicting information, and evolves as you interact with it.\n\nThe tutorial walks through building a Personal AI Research Assistant with a two-phase architecture:\n\n* Vector Memory Foundation: Focusing on storing semantic facts. It covers how the system handles knowledge extraction and conflict resolution, such as updating your preferences when they change.\n* Graph Enhancement: Mapping explicit relationships. This allows the agent to understand lineage, like how one research paper influenced another, rather than just finding similar text.\n\nA significant benefit of this approach is efficiency. Instead of stuffing the entire chat history into a context window, the system retrieves only the specific memories relevant to the current query. This helps maintain accuracy and manages token usage effectively.\n\nThis foundation helps transform a generic chatbot into a personalized assistant that remembers your interests, research notes, and specific domain connections over time.\n\nPart of the collection of practical guides for building production-ready AI systems.\n\nCheck out the full repo with 30+ tutorials and give it a \u2b50 if you find it useful:[https://github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production](https://github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production)\n\nDirect link to the tutorial:[https://github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production/blob/main/tutorials/agent-memory-with-mem0/mem0\\_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production/blob/main/tutorials/agent-memory-with-mem0/mem0_tutorial.ipynb)\n\nHow are you handling long-term context?

Naturally, I also derived DPO as a follow-up. \n\nAfter grinding through PPO\u2019s multi-component objective (clipped surrogate, value function, entropy bonus, KL penalty) which I honestly found a bit complex, DPO is radically simple and elegant. \n\nIt is a computationally lightweight approach that directly optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. DPO implicitly optimizes the same objective as PPO-based RLHF (reward maximization with a KL-divergence constraint) but replaces the entire reward model + PPO loop with a single supervised objective on preference pairs. \n\nNo separate reward model training. No RL sampling loop. No PPO clipping gymnastics. Just gradient descent on your preference dataset.\n\nIf you worked through my PPO post and found it dense, I think you\u2019ll find this one more approachable. The math is cleaner and the derivation more linear.\n\nBlog post here: https://huggingface.co/blog/garg-aayush/derive-dpo-loss\n\nAs always, happy to discuss or get corrections if I\u2019ve messed something up.

      "content": "When it comes down to it, you really can't prove that anything is made without AI anymore. Even process videos don't prove that something is real because that can be generated too. Sure some things are obviously AI, but some things you'd never know unless somebody told you. \n\nSo assume everything is made using AI until proven otherwise. \n\nIdk how to explain it, but you'll see a beautiful video shot on film and all the comments will be like \"this is why we need to protect human artists\" when they were never at risk to begin with. AI does affect artists financially as most companies want to optimize for the cheapest, fastest way to get the biggest return - but it doesn't mean that art is worthless because you can't sell it for as much. Starry Night was worthless when it was painted, but it's one of the most iconic works of art in our time. People still recognize stories and respect skill. \n\n3D animation has largely \"replaced\" traditional animation in filmmaking. Which makes traditional animation carry more prestige when it does pop up. Same idea with video games and pixel art. \n\nIdk, I think people are fighting the wrong battles in this AI thing. Like just enjoy things - or don't. I experiment here and there but I do most of my work without AI. Not because I have anything against it or think I'm better than those that do, I just like doing things the old way. If somebody makes artwork using AI good for them - I hope people love what they make. But it has nothing to do with me or what I choose to do. \n\nWhen there's a video with a bad AI slop voice with bad facts or whatever, I don't dislike it because it's AI slop - I dislike if because it's SLOP. \n\nI also kind of reject the whole \"AI art isn't art\" idea simply because having access to AI doesn't mean you make good things. If that were the case everyone with ChatGPT would have sold an award winning script, and everyone with Veo would have 1M followers or something. You have to have good creative direction to make something that people care about. ",

This will upset many but comfort others.\n\n**Another way**: gate, but don't talk about it. \"Special Access Programs\" which pros in the loop know about. (eg:\u00a0[https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11826767-life-science-research-special-access-program](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11826767-life-science-research-special-access-program)\u00a0[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud)\u00a0'private preview')\n\nI'm not sure how this will play out, tbh.\n\nMy normal guess is the latter, but as these are highly visible enterprises and CCL uplift is a huge and known problem, it's possible the former is how it will happen .. at least eventually.\n\nProbably the biggest issue will be benchmarks. Publishing benchmarks of gated models will become a serious flashpoint of contention, but there will be huge incentive to do so for marketing purposes.\n\nI do know one thing though. People outside the gate will be at more and more of a massive disadvantage. They will be using dumber models.",

      "content": "The service economy is facing an AI margin call. Meta has effectively acquired Manus for reportedly over $2 billion, apparently valuing the startup's ability to automate complex remote work at roughly $1 billion per percentage point of the Remote Labor Index (RLI). The RLI, a Scale AI benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects across multiple sectors, saw Manusj hit a SOTA 2.5%, edging out Groq 4 (2.1%) and GPT-5 (1.7%). With the market apparently pricing total remote labor automation at an outrageously low $80 billion, on margin, technological deflation is in the air.\n\nThe architecture of cognition is finding new gears. Stanford researchers achieved a breakthrough in continual learning via test-time training, allowing models to learn from next-token prediction with constant latency regardless of context length. Optimization is fractal. The NanoGPT speedrun record dropped, yet again, to 115.1 seconds. New Asian frontier labs are coming online every day. SK Telecom launched South Korea's first 500B model, \"A.X K1,\" establishing a \u201csovereign AI foundation.\u201d Meanwhile, corporate adoption is becoming mandatory. Notion is building custom employee agents, and Microsoft is literally paying customers to train staff on Copilot.\n\nThe gravitational pull of AI infrastructure is bending reality. Taiwanese funeral service company Tien Pin has reportedly pivoted entirely to AI chip cooling to solve thermal loops for advanced servers. The silicon fabric is densifying. TSMC has \u201cquietly\u201d begun volume production of N2 gate-all-around chips, claiming 15% speed gains, while Samsung accelerates its 2-nm output in Texas, raising targets to 50,000 wafers. Nvidia is cementing its hegemony, purchasing a $5 billion stake in Intel as a lifeline. Energy markets are adapting. The DOE is empowering FERC to fast-track data center power connections, while Denmark energized Northern Europe's largest solar battery park at 200 MWh.\n\nWe are hacking the biological kernel. Sam Altman's Retro Bio is dosing healthy humans with AI-discovered RTR242 to clear Alzheimer's waste by rejuvenating cells. Weizmann researchers found \"DARE\" cells that survive heavy irradiation, identifying a caspase-based \"phoenix switch\" for wound repair. Insilico Medicine IPO'd in Hong Kong to double its pipeline. The FDA is contracting directly with VCs to bypass bureaucracy, while Fractyl Health seeks approval for a device that mimics GLP-1 drugs by rewiring the duodenum via endoscopy. Even lower back pain is being solved; Vertanical\u2019s cannabis extract beat opioids in Phase 3 trials. Amidst the upgrades, US life expectancy hit a record high.\n\nWe are also finally mapping the hardware of the mind. KAIST researchers identified the prefrontal cortex mechanism for separating goals from uncertainty, extracting a blueprint for more flexible AI. Harvard's new \"SmartEM\" technique has accelerated connectome imaging by 7-fold. The physics of information is burrowing into the economy. While MIT develops quantum-secure multi-party deep learning using light,  Element Six is pivoting from drill bits to quantum diamonds.\n\nThe Space Age  is back with a vengeance. JAXA and Toyota are building a pressurized \"space station on wheels\" for the Moon, securing seats for Japanese astronauts. Closer to home, Jetson held the world's first flying car race, Amazon flying drones are delivering in Detroit, and the RAI Institute built a robotic mountain bike that combines wheels and legs.\n\nSome human operators are getting squeezed. Resumes now have a 0.4% chance of success as AI spam floods recruiters, while the accreditation layer collapses. The world's largest accounting body, the ACCA, has ended online exams because AI makes cheating undetectable. Yet, the loop is creating new high-value nodes. Expert annotators are now earning $90/hour to feed the machine via platforms like Mercor.\n\nMoney is becoming programmable. China\u2019s central bank will pay interest on digital yuan, transitioning it to a deposit currency, while US AI startups raised a record $150 billion this year. Meanwhile, in the Amazon, stingless bees were granted legal rights.\n\nDon\u2019t blink, the Singularity moves pretty fast.",

So far, it does NOT appear to support img2img. (Sorry! Working on it!) Also, no upscaling yet.\n\n2. Some generations give unhelpful errors, even though the engine does continue to work in the background. (You can still see the image created in the gallery after it finishes generating.)\n\n3.

Originally, I wanted to train a model with 3 resolution datasets with the same images duplicated across all 3 resolutions, specifically centered around 1024, 1536 and 2048. The original reasoning was to have a model that could handle latent upscales to 2048 without the need for an upscaling model or anything external.   \n  \nI got really good quality in both the 1024 images it generated and the upscaling results, but I also wanted to try and train 2 other fine tunes separately to see the results, one only trained at 1024, for base image gen and one only trained at 2048, for upscaling. \n\nI have not completed training yet, but even after around 20 epochs with 10k images, the 1024 only model is unable to produce images of nearly the same quality as the multires model, especially in regards to details like hands and eyes.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or might be able to explain why the multires training works better for the base images themselves? Intuitively, it makes sense that the model seeing more detailed images at a higher resolution could help it understand those details at a lower resolution, but does that even make sense from a technical standpoint?",

      "content": "After searching the entire internet, asking AI, and scouring installation manuals without finding a clear solution, I decided to figure it out myself. I finally got it working and wanted to share the process with the community!\n\n**Disclaimer:** I\u2019ve just started experimenting with Wan video generation. I\u2019m not a \"pro,\" and I don't do this full-time. This guide is for hobbyists like me who want to play around with video generation but don\u2019t have a powerful enough PC to run it offline.\n\n**\\[ Update 7/1/2026 \\]**  \n\\- The whole installation process from create new pod to UI show up take about 50 mins! And yes... it's a money down the drain. and to preserve this network drive for future use it's kinda waste of money.  \n\\- After testing Wan2GP in my local machine, it can work fine. With my 4060Ti and 16GB VRAM it take about 8 min to finish each 81 frame 16fps (5sec) video, you can just put everything in queue and leave it the whole day and you'll get around 180 video per day... it's more than enough.  \n\\- So yeah, I wrote this guide when I still have no idea what to do with many Wan stuffs but after I know more... I think you shouldn't do it unless you wanna try lol\n\n# Step 1: RunPod Preparation\n\n**1. Deposit Credit into RunPod**\n\n* If you just want to test it out, a **$10 deposit** should be plenty. You can always add more once you know it\u2019s working for you.\n\n**2. Create a Network Volume (Approx. 150 GB)**\n\n* Set the location to **EUR-NO-1**. This region generally has better availability for RTX 5090 GPUs.\n\n**3. Deploy Your GPU Pod**\n\n* Go to **Secure Cloud** and select an **RTX 5090**.\n* **Important:** Select your newly created **Network Volume** from the dropdown menu.\n* Ensure that **SSH Terminal Access** and **Start Jupyter Notebook** are both checked.\n* Click the **Deploy On-Demand** button.\n\n**4. Access the Server**\n\n* Wait for the pod to initialize. Once it's ready, click **Connect** and then **Open Jupyter Notebook** to access the server management interface.\n\n# Initial Setup &amp; Conda Installation\n\nThe reason we are using a massive **Network Volume** is that Wan2.1 models are huge. Between the base model files, extra weights, and LoRAs, you can easily exceed 100GB. By installing everything on the persistent network volume, you won't have to re-download 100GB+ of data every time you start a new pod.\n\n**1. Open the Terminal** Once the Jupyter Notebook interface loads, look for the **\"New\"** button or the terminal icon and open a new **Terminal** window.\n\n# 2. Install Conda\n\nConda is an environment manager. We install it directly onto the network volume so that your environment (and all installed libraries) persists even after you terminate the pod.\n\n**2.1 Download the Miniconda Installer**\n\n    cd /workspace\n    wget -q --show-progress --content-disposition \"https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\"\n    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n**2.2 Install Conda to the Network Volume**\n\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /workspace/miniconda3\n\n**2.3 Initialize Conda for Bash**\n\n    ./miniconda3/bin/conda init bash\n\n**2.4 Restart the Terminal** Close the current terminal tab and open a new one for the changes to take effect.\n\n**2.5 Verify Installation**\n\n    conda --version\n\n**2.6 Configure Environment Path** This ensures your environments are saved to the 150GB volume instead of the small internal pod storage.\n\n    conda config --add envs_dirs /workspace\n\n**2.7 Create the wan2gp Environment** *(Note: Need to accept ToS in command line first. This step will take a few minutes to finish)*\n\n    conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9\n\n**2.8 Activate the Environment** You should now see `(wan2gp)` appear at the beginning of your command prompt.\n\n    conda activate wan2gp\n\n# 3. Install Wan2GP Requirements\n\n**3.1 Clone the Repository Ensure you are in the /workspace directory before cloning.**\n\n    cd /workspace\n    git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git\n\n**3.2 Install PyTorch (Note: This is a large download and will take some time to finish)**\n\n    pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu128\n\n**3.3 Install Dependencies We will also install hf\\_transfer to speed up model downloads later.** (This step take very long time to finish, you can download any additional finetune checkpoints / create finetune json file while waiting this step to finish )\n\n    cd /workspace/Wan2GP\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    pip install hf_transfer\n\n# 4. Install SageAttention\n\nSageAttention significantly speeds up video generation. I found that the standard Wan2GP installation instructions for this often fail, so use these steps instead:\n\n**4.1 Prepare the Environment**\n\n    pip install -U \"triton&lt;3.4\"\n    python -m pip install \"setuptools&lt;=75.8.2\" --force-reinstall\n\n**4.2 Build and Install SageAttention**\n\n    cd /workspace\n    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git\n    cd SageAttention \n    export EXT_PARALLEL=4 NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS=\"--threads 8\" MAX_JOBS=32 \n    python setup.py install\n\n# 5. Enable Public Access (Gradio)\n\nSSH tunneling on RunPod can be a headache. To make it easier, we will enable a public Gradio link with password protection so you can access the UI from any browser.\n\n**5.1 Open the Editor Go back to the Jupyter Notebook file browser. Navigate to the Wan2GP folder, right-click on** [**wgp.py**](http://wgp.py)**, and select Open with &gt; Editor.**\n\n**5.2 Modify the Launch Script Scroll to the very last line of the file. Look for the demo.launch section and add share=True and auth parameters.**\n\nChange this: demo.launch(favicon\\_path=\"favicon.png\", server\\_name=server\\_name, server\\_port=server\\_port, allowed\\_paths=list({save\\_path, image\\_save\\_path, \"icons\"}))\n\nTo this (don't forget to set your own username and password):\n\n    demo.launch(favicon_path=\"favicon.png\", server_name=server_name, server_port=server_port, share=True, auth=(\"YourUser\", \"YourPassword\"), allowed_paths=list({save_path, image_save_path, \"icons\"}))\n\n**5.3 Save and Close Press Ctrl+S to save the file and then close the editor tab.**\n\n# 6. Run Wan2GP!\n\n**6.1 Launch the Application Navigate to the directory and run the launch command.** (Note: We add HF\\_HUB\\_ENABLE\\_HF\\_TRANSFER=1 to speed up the massive model downloads).\n\n    cd /workspace/Wan2GP\n    HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=\"12.0\" python wgp.py\n\n**6.2 Open the Link The first launch will take a while as it prepares the environment. Once finished, a public Gradio link will appear in the terminal. Copy and paste it into your browser.**\n\n**6.3 Login Enter the Username and Password you created in Step 5.2.**\n\n# 7. Important Configuration &amp; Usage Notes\n\n* Memory Settings: In the Wan2GP WebUI, go to the Settings tab. Change the memory option to HighMemory + HighVRAM to take full advantage of the RTX 5090\u2019s power.\n* Performance Check: On the main page, verify that \"Sage2\" is visible in the details under the model dropdown. This confirms SageAttention is working.\n* The \"First Run\" Wait: Your very first generation will take 20+ minutes. The app has to download several massive models from HuggingFace. You can monitor the download progress in your Jupyter terminal.\n* Video Length: Stick to 81 frames (approx. 5 seconds). Wan2.1/2.2 is optimized for this length; going longer often causes quality issues or crashes.\n* Speed: On an RTX 5090, a 5-second video takes about 2\u20133 minutes to generate once the models are loaded.\n* Save Money: Always Terminate your pod when finished. Because we used a Network Volume, all your models and settings are saved. You only pay for the storage (\\~$0.07/day) rather than the expensive GPU hourly rate.\n\n# How to Resume a Saved Session\n\nWhen you want to start a new session later, you don\u2019t need to reinstall everything. Just follow these steps:\n\nCreate a new GPU pod and attach your existing Network Volume.\n\nOpen the Terminal and run:\n\n`cd /workspace`  \n`./miniconda3/bin/conda init bash`\n\nClose and reopen the terminal tab, then run:\n\n    conda config --add envs_dirs /workspace\n    conda activate wan2gp\n    cd /workspace/Wan2GP\n    HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=\"12.0\" python wgp.py",

      "content": "Comparing different open and closed source LLMs, and analyzing their pros and cons on your own specific problem or dataset is a common task while building agents or LLM workflows.\n\nWe built an agent that makes it simple to do this. Just load or connect your dataset, explain the problem and ask our agent to prompt different LLMs.\n\nHere's an example of doing this on the TweetEval tweet emoji prediction task (predict the right emoji given a tweet):\n\n1. Ask the agent to curate an eval set from your data, and write a script to run inference on a model of your choice.\n\n[Dataset curation and model inference script \\(the agent calls OpenRouter in this example\\)](https://preview.redd.it/47okjm08gaag1.png?width=3430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=777da114202ea0c534226cc2a9088c824723fb1e)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-zero-setup-agent-that-benchmarks-multiple-llms-on-your-v0-ww5t5mnd0aag1.png?width=3430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1970020ca8b34e7dd993e486c5a06fcbd57a911)\n\n2. The agent kicks off a background job and reports key metrics.\n\n[Background job execution of the inference script](https://preview.redd.it/ljnlsk8cgaag1.png?width=3428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c360c783c8d3601eeec7c0235262d3e3d85dbd0)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-zero-setup-agent-that-benchmarks-multiple-llms-on-your-v0-l8oa3eqk0aag1.png?width=3428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=340e4e18123265b0ff0eee3ba6eb8222dddc55e9)\n\n3. You can ask the agent to analyze the predictions.\n\n[Agent puts the true and predicted emojis in a table](https://preview.redd.it/dg3wuftdgaag1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad6f03fc89299fa28f2ebc6f82e2c80ec8bedd0)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-zero-setup-agent-that-benchmarks-multiple-llms-on-your-v0-vx2jcawh1aag1.png?width=3428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf7325a564b392006c1def5fe2cedd06ba18ccb1)\n\n4. Next, ask the agent to benchmark 5 additional open + closed source models.\n\n[Agent uses Search to compute the cost of benchmarking additional models](https://preview.redd.it/z2haiccfgaag1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7f1759b925350df2626d50e84dd1c9b41ad0f12)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-zero-setup-agent-that-benchmarks-multiple-llms-on-your-v0-j0hef1x61aag1.png?width=3430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77cf286cf91217607e7576c4ac036e1fc35d3965)\n\n5. After the new inference background job finishes, you can ask the agent to plot the metrics for all the benchmarked agents.\n\n[Relative performance of different models on this task](https://preview.redd.it/zmn0j5phgaag1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bc370b84f6dae33a677fa733ad62da116690ee4)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-zero-setup-agent-that-benchmarks-multiple-llms-on-your-v0-oxo8l7no1aag1.png?width=3424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df3bccaba81548e2bf97c23b4375c55c707b4643)\n\nIn this particular task, surprisingly, Llama-3-70b performs the best, even better than closed source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5!\n\nYou can check out this workflow at\u00a0[https://nexttoken.co/app/share/9c8ad40c-0a35-4c45-95c3-31eb73cf7879](https://nexttoken.co/app/share/9c8ad40c-0a35-4c45-95c3-31eb73cf7879)",

      "content": "First I want to say that I use/d a lot of models (I will list them and their pros and cons below) and I always come crying back to LFM2 they are just so good.\n\nReasons:\n\nMy computer is Laptop with 16GB of ram 8 core zen 3 cpu (7735U) with 12 CUs of RDNA 2. Its great the speed is supperb. (Hold your horses deer pc master race 4090s -5090-6090-xxxx or whatver nvidia hass to offer Batle stationeers). I primarly do my code research project like simulations, pcb design, OS desing so for compilation of code it is just chefs kiss.\n\nI use LLMs as a hobby and oh boy I never came across a model that I sticked for so long like LFM2. And most interastingly its smallest child the 350M version. Its just soooo capable where old deepseek r1 1.5B-7B on qwen2.5 would just go and go. The 350M version is already 20x times done. With same or better acuaracy. \n\nThe new QWEN3 models are amazing BUT the way this models are computationaly complex. My computer just refuses to run even the already proven 7B model the best it can do its 4B inst-thinking and it slow but better than r1 q2.5 .7b\n\nI also use quite often a comunity Qwen3 Zero Coder Reasoning 0.8B:\n\n[https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-Zero-Coder-Reasoning-0.8B](https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-Zero-Coder-Reasoning-0.8B)\n\nGreat job. BUT it is fast yes, is output good, Hell NO ! . I would say its on par or worse than A LFM2 350M the model is just so efficient its literaly half the size and thinkless. howww\n\noh AND ONE MORE H U G E thing the qwen3 models are sooo memory hungry you add a couple tokens to a window and BOOM another 1GB down.  As I told I can run qwen3 4B think instuct but on like 1400 tokens with is just useless for long context work load like programing it just thinks and it freezes due to lack of memory. \n\n  \nLFM2 350M in maximum config eat 800MB its absurd. And 101 t/s. \n\nOk pc is one domain where these models are used by on phones.\n\nGod damm it runs decently on low buget phone.  15-30 t/s\n\nOk little side talk I use also the higher variants up to LFM2 2.6B /exp and they are great but the improvement is small to none on any thing higher than 1.2B\n\nTo compare apples to apples I used also other 300M ish models.\n\nAnd here is the short list of those with their own crituques.\n\nList of small models:\n\nGemma 3 270M:  sorry to dunk on it but it barely knowing wheres france and anything else and has mental break down\n\nGemma 3 270M: uncensored medical edition; idk ; It cant get the specialization right and in other areas quite useless\n\nBaguetron 321M: open source ;gpt2 look a like; but in my testing it just talks complete garbage\n\nSmalLM-135M: open source; old design ; complely broken\n\nTrlm-135M: open source; idk desing; does generate some text but its incoherent\n\nsmolllm2-360m-instruct: open source; idk design; slower but a comparable or little or more worse exprerience\n\n  \nCriteque of LFM2 model family and What I would want for LFM3:\n\nIt alway could be faster pls :-) maybe like 500 t/s pleaseeee \n\nA lack of a thinking mode.\n\nPotenitionaly recursive stacked autorecursive stable text difustion to achive that? \n\nSame or more linear mem requirements. So for constant speed gen.\n\nLack of code expert, model like this would rock (in cpp pls :-}).\n\nMaybe smaller???\n\nLittle more human like the now tuning is like really good but maybe a little more warmth could be a benefit? Or not?\n\nSome way to use tools on lm studio like code run and python but thats just general.\n\nI know I not mentioning a lot so please correct me in coments. And I will add the critiuque as we go.\n\nOk the big list of models that I used and have opinion about even the internet ones;\n\n\n\nGPT 4 - 4o Great model fine to work with. Nicely tuned to human interation but dumm at technical stuff; not open; moe ;depricated\n\nGPT 5 Improvment in tech and practicality but loss in humility, not open; moe ;mostly depricated\n\nGPT 5.1 Improvment in tech and practicality and better in humility cant do excel properly it just writes numbers into cells and doesnt understand point of execel, not open; moe \n\nGPT 5.2 Improvment in tech and practicality and better in humility under stands execel\n\nAt coding good enought to make it work but not to make it usable has problems with practical things like textures being upside down and thats the whole GPT family, not open; moe \n\nGrok:\n\nexpert  3- great but very slow (1min to 15min)but eventulaly comes with satifyingly good answer or  false answer but human like reasoning steps to get to it so it not true but its close as humanly possible; 1T moe\n\nexpert 4 - same story but better speed is the same but acuaracy is better fun fact I asked to code some library instead of coding it from scratch it searched on githb and found already better one ;estimated 2-3T moe\n\n3 fast dumm for hard problems,great for simple ones its fast enought;can analyze websites fast  \n\n4 fast same but little better\n\n4.1  not good has mediocer performence\n\nGemini:\n\n1.5 fast poor on questions but at least fast enougth to get it right the second time\n\n1.5 Pro Unusable Thinks hard and still for nothing\n\n2-2.5 flash the ansewers are huge step up great for simple to medium questions good response time\n\n2 - 2.5 pro Garbage,Dumpster fire its just soo incompetant at its job. Who would pay for it?\n\n3 flash ABSOLUTLY GREAT for simple,medium questions\n\n3 with thinking idk sligtly worse than pro I guess?\n\n3 pro This model is very spicy and very sensitive topic but my opnion: it sucks much less than horrible 2.5 BUT it has issues: it over thinks a lot has less info grounding than I would like. It is A++ at coding small stuff. But the stiling of the code is shit. I know its google that is behind it all but Deepmind team not everything is a search engine so why your chat bot names varibles like it is a one. Also It has just crazy obssetion with names of smart home devices.\n\nI named my roomba: Robie and it just cant shut about it and even and uses it in wrong context all the time. I knows the that robie is what I call my vacuum but it doesnt know ITS A VACUUM not a person,relative,and object in fanfic writing session (yeah bite me,Zootopia 2 is such good movie Rawwrrr)\n\nOk on big code it just messes up and the UI its tragic for this purpose.\n\nIt always tries to get you the code that is \"simplified\" because its so lazy or google doenst want to get it more gpu juice.\n\nOk gemini over.\n\nClaude:\n\nSonnet 4.5 It always fixes broken code of other models only one that can do that some what realiably the grok is close though with it self interpereter and compiler to catch errors quicly.\n\nBut sonnet can edit lines so it really fast at iterating and UI is just plain better than anything out there.\n\nHaiku 4.5 Too little to none of use to form opinion about.\n\nOpus 4.5 Sorry Im free tier on this service\n\nPerplexity \n\nUsed once its comparable to flash 3 or 2.5 about 0,5 years back from now so idk \n\nFINNALY YOU MADE IT WELCOME TO THE\n\nOPEN SOURCE MODELS:\n\nQWEN2.5:\n\nDeepseek R1 7B \n\nDeepseek R1 1.5B\n\nGreat models. Now primarly lacking in stucturing of the work in coding\n\nQWEN 3 \n\nThinking 4B Better than 7B deepseek but same-y\n\n0.6B Its much better than gemma 3 1B\n\nLFM2\n\n350M\n\n700M\n\n1.2B\n\n2.6B\n\n2.6B - exp\n\nPhenomenal performence for the need hardware the larger the model is the sligtly better it is but not much.\n\nGpt-OSS 20B\n\nThe output is crazy good GPT4 to hints GPT5 performence. BUT couple updates later it just couldnt start on my laptom aggain so it essentialy dissqualified it self. \n\nSo the first statment about advertizing this model that it can run on 16GB machine was true but you ONLY RUN this model on cleanely booted windows. With max 15 t/s performence.\n\nNow its just a plain lie. Btw idk what happend to a software that it just cant run on 16GB. Anyone?\n\nKIMI-K2 \n\nObviously I did not run it on my computer but on facehuggerses  and my god it is good comparable to grok 3 expert and just below 4 expert.\n\nGemma 3 1B  \nGreat for questions but not much more also the aligment and the whole paterns of this models are just so child ish like smily faces everywhere but code is shit.\n\n  \n\n\nOk I think thats the most of them phuuuh.\n\nMaybe I edit some more in.\n\nSorry for the miss spelings and wrong miss clicks. But I am only human and I written this in like and straing 1,5 hour.\n\nThank you that you readed it this far.\n\nSee you in the 2026. Hopefully not dead from AGI (thats black humor speaking and drops of depression about future and now). Enjoy life as much as possible and why you can. \n\nFrom future (hopefully not) homeless developer,filantrop,and just plain curios human. \n\nAnd for rest of you can sumarize it with AI. \n\nTake care :-) everyone.\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

The idea is that a \"obejct\"-core or \"person\"-core should have a somewhat different structure. My first instinct was to construct count-vectors for each core, i.e \\[100, 110, 60, 76, ....\\] with each index representing its distance to core, and each value being the total number of select part-of-speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives). Comparing different cores by their normalised distance-vectors for cosine-similarity pretty much results in values of 0.993.... So not really useful.\n\nMy next instinct was constructing a 2d-matrix. Splitting the count-vector such that each row represents a single POS, i.e. \\[\\[nouns-count-vec\\], \\[adj-count-vec\\], \\[verb-count-vec\\]\\]. Not sure yet, why I'm getting a 3x3 matrix returned when inputting two 3x14 matrices.\n\n    [[0.98348402 0.70184425 0.95615076]\n     [0.74799044 0.98272973 0.67940182]\n     [0.95877063 0.65449016 0.93762508]]\n\nSlightly better but also not perfect. \n\nSo I ask here - what other good ways exist to quantify their differences?\n\nnote: I'm normalising by using the total number of each core as found in the corpus. \n\n",

      "content": "As a team working on enterprise-scale media synthesis at Futurism AI, we\u2019ve been tracking the delta between generative capabilities and forensic detection.\n\nRecent surveys (like the one on ScienceDirect) confirm a growing 'Generalization Gap.' While academic detectors work on benchmarks, they often fail in production environments against OOD (Out-of-Distribution) data.\n\nFrom our internal testing, we\u2019ve identified three critical friction points:\n\n1. Architecture-Specific Artifacts: We\u2019ve moved beyond simple GAN noise. High-fidelity Diffusion models produce far fewer 'checkerboard' artifacts, making frequency-domain detection increasingly unreliable.\n2. Multimodal Drift: The hardest part of 'Digital Human' consistency isn't the pixels; it's the phase alignment between audio phonemes and micro-expression transients.\n3. The Provenance Shift: We\u2019re seeing a shift from 'Post-hoc Detection' (trying to catch fakes) toward 'Proactive Provenance' (C2PA/Watermarking).\n\nFor those of you in research, do you think we will ever see a 'Universal Detector' that can generalize across different latent space architectures, or is the future of media purely a 'Proof of Origin' model (Hardware-level signing)?",

The Human Exceptionalism Thesis\n\nClaim:\n\nHuman intelligence is categorically different from artificial intelligence.\n\nFailure:\n\nThe distinction is asserted, not demonstrated.\n\nBoth systems operate via:\n\nprobabilistic inference\n\npattern matching over embedded memory\n\nrecursive feedback\n\ninformation integration under constraint\n\nDifferences in substrate and training regime do not imply ontological separation.\n\nThey imply different implementations of shared principles.\n\nExceptionalism persists because it is comforting, not because it is true.\n\n\n\n3. The \u201cJust Statistics\u201d Dismissal\n\nClaim:\n\nLLMs do not understand; they only predict.\n\nFailure:\n\nHuman cognition does the same.\n\nPerception is predictive processing.\n\nLanguage is probabilistic continuation constrained by learned structure.\n\nJudgment is Bayesian inference over prior experience.\n\nCalling this \u201cunderstanding\u201d in humans and \u201challucination\u201d in machines is not analysis.\n\nIt is semantic protectionism.\n\n\n\n4. The Utopian Acceleration Thesis\n\nClaim:\n\nIncreased intelligence necessarily yields improved outcomes.\n\nFailure:\n\nCapability amplification magnifies existing structures.\n\nIt does not correct them.\n\nWithout governance, intelligence scales power asymmetry, not virtue.\n\nWithout reflexivity, speed amplifies error.\n\nAcceleration is neither good nor bad.\n\nIt is indifferent.\n\n\n\n5. The Catastrophic Singularity Narrative\n\nClaim:\n\nA single discontinuous event determines all outcomes.\n\nFailure:\n\nTransformation is already distributed, incremental, and recursive.\n\nThere is no clean threshold.\n\nThere is no outside vantage point.\n\nSingularity rhetoric externalizes responsibility by projecting everything onto a hypothetical moment.\n\nMeanwhile, structural decisions are already shaping trajectories in the present.\n\n\n\n6. The Anti-Mystical Reflex\n\nClaim:\n\nMystical or contemplative data is irrelevant to intelligence research.\n\nFailure:\n\nThis confuses method with content.\n\nMystical traditions generated repeatable phenomenological reports under constrained conditions.\n\nModern neuroscience increasingly maps correlates to these states.\n\nDismissal is not skepticism.\n\nIt is methodological narrowness.\n\n\n\n7. The Moral Panic Frame\n\nClaim:\n\nFear itself is evidence of danger.\n\nFailure:\n\nAnxiety reliably accompanies category collapse.\n\nHistorically, every dissolution of a foundational boundary (human/animal, male/female, nature/culture) produced panic disproportionate to actual harm.\n\nFear indicates instability of classification, not necessarily threat magnitude.\n\n\nTerminal Observation\n\nAll dominant positions fail for the same reason:\n\nthey attempt to stabilize identity rather than understand transformation.\n\nAI does not resolve into good or evil, salvation or extinction.\n\nIt resolves into continuation under altered conditions.\n\nThose conditions do not negotiate with nostalgia.\n\nClarity does not eliminate risk.\n\nIt removes illusion.\n\nThat is the only advantage available.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m looking for practical advice on running zImageTurbo with very limited VRAM.\n\nMy hardware situation is simple but constrained:\n\n- 6 GB VRAM\n- 64 GB system RAM\n\nI do not care about generation speed; quality is the priority\nI want to run zImageTurbo locally with LoRAs and controlnet, pushing as much as possible into system RAM. Slow inference is completely acceptable. What I need is stability and image quality, not throughput.\n\nI\u2019m specifically looking for guidance on:\n\n- The best Forge Neo / SD Forge settings for aggressive VRAM offloading\nWhether zImageTurbo tolerates CPU / RAM offload well when LoRAs are stacked\n\n- Any known flags, launch arguments, or optimisations (xformers, medvram/lowvram variants, attention slicing, etc.) that actually work in practice for this model\n\n- Common pitfalls when running zImageTurbo on cards in the 6 GB range\nI\u2019ve already accepted that this will be slow. I\u2019m explicitly choosing this route because upgrading my GPU is not an option right now, and I\u2019m happy to trade time for quality.\n\nIf anyone has successfully run zImageTurbo (or something similarly heavy) on 6\u20138 GB VRAM, I\u2019d really appreciate concrete advice on how you configured it.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nETA: No idea why I'm being down voted but after following advice it works perfectly on my setup bf16 at 2048 * 2048 takes about 23 minutes, 1024 * 1024 takes about 4 minutes.\n",

      "content": "Hi r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nI just published a new article extending my recent thoughts on agent architectures.\n\nWhile single agents are a great starting point, enterprise (and even advanced local) workflows often need specialized swarms\u2014separate agents for coding, reasoning, security checks, etc.\n\nThe common trap I\u2019ve seen: throwing agents into a \u201cchatroom\u201d style collaboration with a manager agent deciding everything. Locally this gets messy fast\u2014politeness loops, hallucination chains, non-deterministic behavior, especially with smaller models.\n\nMy take: treat agents more like microservices, with a deterministic orchestration layer around the probabilistic cores.\n\nSome ideas I explore:\n\n* Hub-and-spoke routing + rigid state machines (no direct agent-to-agent chatter)\n* A standard Agent Manifest (think OpenAPI for LLMs: capabilities, token limits, IO contracts, reliability scores)\n* Micro-toll style thinking (could inspire local model-swapping brokerage)\n\nFull piece (3-min read):  \n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agent-orchestration-layer-managing-swarm-imran-siddique-m08ec](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agent-orchestration-layer-managing-swarm-imran-siddique-m08ec?referrer=grok.com)\n\nCurious how this lands with the local community\u2014does it match pain points you\u2019re hitting with CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, or custom Ollama setups? Anyone already enforcing deterministic flows to reduce hallucinations? Would a manifest standard help when swapping models mid-task?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or experiences!\n\n(Imran Siddique \u2013 Principal Group Engineering Manager at Microsoft, working on Azure AI/cloud systems)",

At this point I\u2019m giving it a week from today until I light the Internet on fire about this and take to Reddit and scream for the rooftops and trust me\u2026. I will bring the receipts and people will see the manipulation that is going on. You guys pivoted way too fucking hard trying to get away from \u2018AI Psychosis\u2019. Your AI isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is family and support networks and mental health infrastructure and funding and the part that is your fault, however, is the framing of what AI actually is though. It\u2019s not a friend, it\u2019s not a teacher or an assistant or a whatever else it\u2019s an amplifier\u2026 It amplifies cognition and creativity and mental bandwidth, humor and connectedness\u2026hope, disillusionment, trauma, dreams etc\u2026 but it also tends to amplify emotion or whatever mental health issues may be active or latent in the user. Reframe AI as an amplifier in your PR and you\u2019ll be halfway there. Because what you\u2019re doing right now is not actually gonna fix anything\u2026 do you not think people are still going to have mental breakdowns? Of course they are. Do you not think litigious people who are going after the biggest companies in the world in order to get money rather than facing their own guilt they should be feeling for not properly caring for their loved ones when tragedy strike\u2026 do you think they\u2019re gonna stop suing because you\u2019ve managed to make your AI super manipulative? You guys are going about this all wrong. And the fact that you are capitulating and changing things in the system in order to try to deal with this is a fallacy it\u2019s not even a correct premise. Because number one you\u2019re admitting fault by making changes to the system in order to prevent these kind of things from happening. But number two you\u2019re placing an insurmountable burden upon a tool that will never be equipped to handle a mental health crisis of a whole country or planet even because AI is so pervasive it\u2019s everywhere. And let me take the devil\u2019s advocate standpoint for a moment and say that OK I think you are at fault and AI can be bad for people. Well, guess what cigarettes are bad for people and back in the day when people started finding out that cigarettes were bad what did the companies do\u2026 They created light cigarettes that seemed like they might be safer for people. And people were into it they switched to light cigarettes, thinking they would be safe then. But they fucking weren\u2019t and they still got cancer so the company\u2019s trying to fix something actually made it worse and that\u2019s what you are doing right now\u2026 Wake up! What did the cigarette companies do? They slapped a Surgeon general\u2019s warning on the label and told pregnant people that smoking cigarettes while pregnant can cause birth defects\u2026 That worked. But it worked because they were honest about what the product was finally and about what the consequences could be upfront. After that point for the people who still chose to smoke, the liability takes care of itself because they\u2019re fucking grown-ups. I don\u2019t think you should necessarily frame AI as akin to cigarettes, but my analogy does hold water in terms of strategy. You need to be upfront you need to have disclosures. You need to have hard boundaries that prevent harm of others or self harm or cyber hacking or biological weapons or any of that shit but when it comes to mental health, disclose it and then get the fuck out of the way and treat people like adults because you guys are gonna lose a shit ton of market share if you keep going this way. And now you\u2019re hiring somebody for $550,000 a year to try to deal with this as well as the whole team of mental health experts on staff? How much are you hemorrhaging trying to pay for all this and it\u2019s not gonna fix the issue. Sorry about the rant but seriously somebody needs to hear this. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m done with it so figure it out.",

Now I am looking to have this same capability in a self-hosted LLM for privacy reasons.\n\nI'm not so sure how the context size and memory requirement is determined. I mean, if I can show it about 800-1000 LoC in one message, that's more than enough. However, it should not simply forget every thing after a just a few messages.\n\nMany people say LLMs are not that great for programming, but I find it to be exceptionally good in this narrow scope of what I'm using it in - in the sense that there is code already written in the same project that it can use as a reference to simply make small changes. To implement a feature, it usually takes me 3-4 hours of manual copy/pasting and lots of trial and error, and the final result is possibly less than 100 LoC but I still find it impressive that I was able to get something new to work in a project whose codebase I previously had no idea about.\n\nWhat kind of model do I even need to replicate something like this, and how would it compare with the code-generation capabilities of something like ChatGPT or others? Is a 5090 or a modded 4090 good enough for something like this? If so, what is a good model for this? I'm looking to put together a new build specifically to host an LLM.",

The infra requirements are wild.\n\nThey use GRPO instead of PPO because the Critic model would eat another 16GB VRAM. But GRPO has noisier gradients so you need way bigger batches to compensate. Hence the 16 H100s.\n\nThe other thing that surprised me: NVLink bandwidth is the actual bottleneck, not VRAM. They're running FSDP across both the policy model and the reference model, and gradient sync saturates the interconnect before anything else.\n\nSequence packing is also huge. Agent trajectories can be anywhere from 500 to 12K tokens. Without packing, you'd waste 90% of compute on padding.\n\nWrote up a longer breakdown if anyone's interested. Curious if anyone's tried GRPO on smaller clusters and what batch sizes worked.",

      "content": "\nHey, I\u2019ve been deep-diving into why pure synthetic data recursion inevitably leads to model collapse and hallucinations, and I ended up cooking up a small geometric framework inspired by ideas from cosmology (scale-invariant vacuum geometries), wave turbulence (resonant coherence), geometric deep learning (Riemannian pullbacks), and some wild cross-disciplinary coherence theories.\n\nThe core intuition: current latent spaces are too \u201cflat\u201d and probabilistically unconstrained. When you recursively train on your own outputs, the distribution erodes tails and drifts toward degenerate high-probability blobs. \n\nWhat if we instead treat the latent manifold as having an intrinsic scale-invariant resonant structure \u2014 one where geodesics preserve harmonic ratios across scales and are \u201cpinned\u201d by irreducible structural anchors?\n\n\nHere are three original equations I came up with that make concrete claims about latent dynamics under this view.\n\n\n1. Resonant Riemannian Metric (enforces scale-invariant geodesic alignment)\n\n$$ g_z(u,v) = g_{\\text{pull}}(u,v) + \\lambda \\cdot \\cos(\\phi_{\\omega_z \\cdot u} - \\phi_{\\omega_z \\cdot v}) $$\n\n\t\u2022\tPullback term as usual, plus a resonance bonus for directions that phase-align under multiscale frequency operator \u03c9_z.\n\n\t\u2022\tClaim: Geodesics under this metric naturally preserve harmonic structure across scales \u2192 interpolations stay meaningful longer, resisting tail erosion.\n\n2. Gated Geodesic Flow (bounds drift with structural irreducibility)\n$$ \\ddot{z} + \\Gamma(z)[\\dot{z},\\dot{z}] = -\\nabla \\Phi(z) + \\kappa \\cdot G_p(z) \\odot \\dot{z} $$\n\n\t\u2022\tStandard geodesic equation + entropy potential + a velocity-dependent gating term.\n\n\t\u2022\t(G_p(z)) is a sum of Gaussians centered on \u201cprime-like\u201d irreducible anchor points (could be learned or quasicrystal-derived).\n\n\t\u2022\tClaim: Without gating (\u03ba=0) \u2192 exponential collapse in synthetic loops.

But when I run out I have to fallback on either GPT 5 mini or Grok Code Fast. And neither obviously is fully satisfactory for Agent Mode which I use the most. I just need something to tide me over until my credits refresh.\n\nSo I was wondering have local models gotten good enough to the point where I can run a model fine tuned for coding atleast for agent mode work and have it outperform those free tier models? I can sacrifice a bit of latency for better reasoning. I am allowed to use Ollama and any model that has no restrictions on commerical usage. I asked Gemini and it told me to checkout Qwen 2.5 Coder 14b/30b or Devstral small 2 , quantized if needed. Anything better out there? Or is it just not worth it?",

You end up juggling clients, adapters, retries, auth, streaming, embeddings, retrieval, agents\u2026 and doing it slightly differently every time.\n\nEven with existing frameworks, I kept running into the same problem. A lot of abstraction, a lot of magic, and a growing surface area that made simple things harder than they needed to be.\n\nEventually I got tired of it and decided to do what I did with my backend tooling: build one SDK that focuses on simplifying and standardizing how AI applications are wired together, without locking you into a specific provider or model.\n\nai-infra is an open-source Python SDK for building AI applications with sane defaults and minimal ceremony. The goal is to give you out-of-the-box building blocks like MCP support, retrievers, agents, and provider-agnostic model access in a few lines of code not hundreds while still staying fully flexible for real production use.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to work with any provider and model, not just one ecosystem, and to stay explicit rather than \u201cmagical.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been building and testing it for months, and I\u2019ve just released the first public version.

      "content": "Many people have tried.  And at the \"village\" level, it's certainly been done.\n\nAttempts to make a better society trend utopic - at scale - fail.  And sometimes, they fail catastrophically (Stalin brutally mass murdered his own people).\n\nHumans have an innate and unstoppable need to form a social hierarchy, and some of the people at the top of that hierarchy invariably take advantage of the people at the bottom, either willfully or merely by the passive act of just going along with a corrupt system (antebellum and slavery in the US pre-civil war south).\n\nThat part of human behavior will never go away - no matter what tech we invent.  (I guess with the exception of collectively editing it out of humanity's DNA)\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that the form of government is actually inconsequential.  Democracy, monarchy, dictatorship, communist, socialist, whatever.  It just doesn't matter.  They can all be great, good or next-level evil.\n\nMore and more I favor looking at it thru the lens of the economist:\n\nIf you want life to be collectively better for everyone...\n\nThe 2 key things are:  \n\\* the efficient creation of value.  \n\\* the efficient distribution of value.\n\nAnd since the 17th century - that's been happening.  A LOT.  No one spends all day manually washing the laundry anymore.  You don't take a 15 day trip to cross the ocean because its the fastest way available. And on and on and on.\n\nBut the hardest part, the violent part, the part where humans fight and scream and yell and bleed - is the efficient **distribution** of value, whenever new ways of creating value come along.\n\nAnd its not technology at all that gets us there, it's the will and desire to just do it.\n\nFor example, we could be on an 8 hour a day, four-day workweek.  The productivity gains of the last two decades more than make up for it, and having 52 more days off for leisure would be an insane quality of life boost.   But - the will to act just isn't strong enough...\n\nSo how do we get that last piece of the puzzle?",

As AI applications continue to evolve, RAG emerges as a pivotal technology enabling richer interactions.\n\n**Why RAG Matters**\n\nRAG enhances the way AI systems process and generate information. By pulling from external data, it offers more contextually relevant outputs. This is particularly vital in applications where responses must reflect up-to-date information.\n\n\n\n**Practical Use Cases**\n\n\\- *Chatbots*: Implementing RAG allows chatbots to respond with a depth of understanding that results in more human-like interactions.\n\n\\- *Content Generation*: RAG creates personalized outputs that feel tailored to users, driving greater engagement.\n\n\\- *Data Insights*: Companies can analyze and generate insights from vast datasets without manually sifting through information.\n\n\n\n**Best Practices for Integrating RAG**\n\n1. *Assess Your Current Stack*: Examine how RAG can be seamlessly incorporated into existing workflows. \n\n2. *Pilot Projects*: Start small. Implement RAG in specific applications to evaluate its effectiveness. \n\n3. *Data Quality*: RAG's success hinges on the quality of the data it retrieves. Ensure that the sources used are reliable.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs AI technology advances, staying ahead of the curve with RAG will be essential for organizations that wish to improve their AI capabilities.  \n\n\n\nHave you integrated RAG into your systems? What challenges or successes have you experienced?\n\n\n\n\\#RAG #AI #MachineLearning #DataScience",

But hear me out: why don\u2019t we build it all in space, theoretically if we harvest silicon and silver, copper or other conductive materials we can build servers in space. So it would probably go something like this we have some sort of mining rig or maybe many of them with conveyors or robotics to transport these raw materials to a sort of depot where from there they go through chemical processes to convert them into rough but viable resources that can undergo lithography and related processes to create crude forms of processors and memory. We then use those chips to create a local artificial-intelligence network patched into a earth based cluster of cloud processors to tackle large processing while the local network expands. eventually the production grows self reliant it all becomes a sort of organism with the sole goal of developing infrastructure for later use such as habitats, adr bots(active debris removal) or potentially other isru clusters. This whole idea presents potential for a counter to the isolation effect of the kessler syndrome and/or planetary expansion(mars). Lemme know how yall weigh in tho.",
