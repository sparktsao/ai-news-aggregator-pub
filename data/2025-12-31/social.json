Just judged its hackathon and was inspired by the creativity of its community, which measures into the millions. \n\nI was blessed to be able to interview YouWare's founder, which gives many insights into his company, its product, and into what the Chinese ecosystem is doing. \n\nWith YouWare you can start with someone else's app and \"remix\" it. Theft? No. Open Source and everyone in the community knows the game. This way apps get taken further and customized for niches. And the whole ecosystem gets better together as more people join and do the same. \n\nAnother one? @boardyai which helps entrepreneurs build their companies. Thousands are already using it. You talk to it on the phone. It can help you with code, or with a problem with an employee, and once it senses you are ready it hooks you up with investors.\n\nThe more who join the more disruptive it gets.\n\nCommunity building is the skill that will be most in demand next year, particularly as we head toward Holodecks.",

Nitroglycerin, a teaspoonful of which would blow you to fragments, surrounds you in hundreds and thousands of gallons. It is making itself in huge tanks, gurgling merrily along open leaden gutters, falling ten feet in brown waterfalls, so to speak, into tanks of soda solution, and bubbling so furiously in other cylinders, through the in-rush of cold air from below, that it seems to be boiling.\n\nIt is being draw off from large porcelain taps like ale, poured into boxes, and rattled along tramways - all these processes proceeding as rapidly as if it were ordinary olive-oil instead of the deadliest explosive known to man.\n\nThe product would suffice, if it were to explode, to cut you off in the beauty of your youth. Death instantaneous and pulverizing, encircles you, in fact, by the ton; but the man and the thermometer surround you also. The man’s eyes never leaves the instrument.”",
