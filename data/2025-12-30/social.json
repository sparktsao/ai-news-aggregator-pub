      "content": "Another year of rapid AI advances has created more opportunities than ever for anyone — including those just entering the field — to build software. In fact, many companies just can’t find enough skilled AI talent. Every winter holiday, I spend some time learning and building, and I hope you will too. This helps me sharpen old skills and learn new ones, and it can help you grow your career in tech.\n\nTo be skilled at building AI systems, I recommend that you:\n- Take AI courses\n- Practice building AI systems\n- (Optionally) read research papers\n\nLet me share why each of these is important.\n\nI’ve heard some developers advise others to just plunge into building things without worrying about learning. This is bad advice! Unless you’re already surrounded by a community of experienced AI developers, plunging into building without understanding the foundations of AI means you’ll risk reinventing the wheel or — more likely — reinventing the wheel badly!\n\nFor example, during interviews with job candidates, I have spoken with developers who reinvented standard RAG document chunking strategies, duplicated existing evaluation techniques for Agentic AI, or ended up with messy LLM context management code. If they had taken a couple of relevant courses, they would have better understood the building blocks that already exist. They could still rebuild these blocks from scratch if they wished, or perhaps even invent something superior to existing solutions, but they would have avoided weeks of unnecessary work. So structured learning is important. Moreover, I find taking courses really fun. Rather than watching Netflix, I prefer watching a course by a knowledgeable AI instructor any day!\n\nAt the same time, taking courses alone isn’t enough. There are many lessons that you’ll gain only from hands-on practice. Learning the theory behind how an airplane works is very important to becoming a pilot, but no one has ever learned to be a pilot just by taking courses. At some point, jumping into the pilot's seat is critical! The good news is that by learning to use highly agentic coders, the process of building is the easiest it has ever been. And learning about AI building blocks might inspire you with new ideas for things to build. If I’m not feeling inspired about what projects to work on, I will usually either take courses or read research papers, and after doing this for a while, I always end up with many new ideas. Moreover, I find building really fun, and I hope you will too.\n\nFinally, not everyone has to do this, but I find that many of the strongest candidates on the job market today at least occasionally read research papers. While I find research papers much harder to digest than courses, they contain a lot of knowledge that has not yet been translated to easier-to-understand formats. I put this much lower priority than either taking courses or practicing building, but if you have an opportunity to strengthen your ability to read papers, I urge you to do so too. I find taking courses and building to be fun, and reading papers can be more of a grind, but the flashes of insight I get from reading papers are delightful.\n\nHave a wonderful winter holiday and a Happy New Year. In addition to learning and building, I hope you'll spend time with loved ones — that, too, is important!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/MaWDs0AbzG ]",

      "content": "Thank you for your consideration of this matter.  I am sorry I don't have more cheerful words to say about it.  I, too, wish that it was not happening like this.  But since it is, there are still last battles worth fighting, just in case the larger war goes less poorly than predicted.\n\n\"If we are going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb,\" wrote C. S. Lewis, \"let that bomb, when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things -- praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts -- not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.\"  Personally, in Lewis's shoes I should also have troubled myself to say there, that being in the process of digging a new fallout shelter is also a good way to meet that sudden awful flash, or distributing iodine tablets in schools; and not just playing darts.\n\nMany sensible people and perhaps a literal majority thought the Bomb would fall in its due time, back then in those days.  World War 1 *and then* World War 2 had just seemed to demonstrate very thoroughly, that all the good wishes of all the good people in the world, could not prevent stupid wars from still going on happening.\n\nFrom the perspective of somebody who thought they knew a lot about political history, but to whom nuclear physics seemed much more mysterious, it might've seemed reasonable to give up on \"countries being reasonable\" as a lost cause; and hope instead that the supergeniuses of the Pentagon had maybe secretly invented some sort of amazing defensive field that would prevent fission or fusion reactions inside of falling bombs.\n\nBut in fact it turned out that the easy technical call was to say that IF you detonated a nuclear bomb, THEN it would produce destruction.  The more difficult predictive call, it proved, was to forecast the true future course of politics and human events.  So it was from the less technical matter that was harder to predict, that the surprising absence of Death proved to come.\n\nHumanity's non-death didn't happen automatically or without people trying at it.  Good and serious people worked hard at diplomacy and on installing more locks on nuclear weapons.  According to one recent history book, this began with Truman establishing the rule that the Presidency and not the military was in charge of that decision... shortly after Hiroshima proved not to be a military target as Truman had at first thought he'd been told... and Nagasaki had then been bombed by military decision, without Presidential signoff at all.  The earliest trends were not encouraging!  They looked like things going as straightly to hell as World War 1.  But despite early ill trends, some people said, \"Okay, no, how about if not that\", and in the end it worked.\n\nAs we later learned, Vasily Arkhipov was the sole dissenting vote of three votes required, in order for a Soviet submarine to use its tactical nuclear weapons during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Salvation wasn't automatic.  Salvation wasn't free.  Salvation does not in retrospect look like it was a straight-line easy path.  Salvation didn't come from 'pessimists' being wrong about the technical question of what would physically happen if anyone detonated an explosive shell surrounding an enriched uranium core, and the resulting fission cascade released X-rays that thermally expanded foam that compressed lithium and deuterium into fusing.\n\nRather we are still here, for now, because people proved wrong about the Great Powers being helplessly unable to not destroy themselves.  And that's not because it was normal or natural or easy, for the Great Powers not to go to war; but because some good and very serious people worked hard on having the default thing not happen.\n\nIn a very ordinary and realistic way, it cost money to do some of that work of not launching the nukes.  Nowhere near as much money as actually manufacturing nuclear bombs, not by a factor of one hundred.  But some.  Of course there were also many charities that sprung up to do nonsense about it, as if it were a matter of just everyone feeling bad about the word 'nuclear', or just restraining your own countries from spending so much money on nukes and never mind detente.  But there were also some charities and think-tanks that were about international treaties, and there is no reason to think their work did not matter.\n\nWhen the Bomb didn't come, it found some people with some amount less money in their bank accounts, for everything they'd done or helped to do to prevent the Bomb from coming.  Then those people died of old age or in car accidents, and most of them didn't get cryonically suspended.  But if all that was written on their tombstone was, \"They died with less money, because they tried in a reasonable way to stop the Bomb from dropping\" -- then what more could any human being possibly ask to have written on their tombstone, if they had to die at all?\n\nAnd if the Bomb had come, it would in many cases have found those people doing well.  Not all.  It can be hard, to be doing well, and harder for some people than others.  I am not tempted to spend my last days on heroin and sex workers because I find it actually quite difficult to have fun at that sort of thing.  If some of the people who fought their own era's battle and their own version of the Last Death, didn't manage to also do well on every day of their lives; well, probably that was ultimately a skill issue, but it might've also been that they happened to be handed a hard problem.\n\nBut whether or not the Bomb would have found them doing well, it would have found them doing right.\n\nIt can be simpler to do right, than to do well, if you have successfully discarded many illusions and distractions along the way.  And of the two, I should say for my own part, and likewise I spent my days: that while both are important, if you can only do one, better to do right than to do well.\n\nIf Death comes, let it find you doing right.",

Chatbots like Opus 4.5 handle that effectively with a minimum of back and forth.\n\nIt's hard to tell for DBAs and network/system administrators, not my domain, but I think it wouldn't be too difficult for a chatbot to be finetuned to understand how networking works in a specific cloud environment or how to scale a database in this cloud. That's not rocket science.\n\nAs I have been saying for a couple of years now, manual or semi-manual programming will remain in domains for which we can't find code online. For example, when you have a bank with a mainframe and custom software that balances debits and credits or makes international transactions, using extremely niche APIs. A chatbot there would be not predictable enough.\n\nBut creating a corporate website or an online store and make it work with some backend like Shopify will work as follows:\n\n1. The client chooses a domain name.\n2. The client types what the website should do (e.g. sell items from this Google spreadsheet).\n3. The chatbot creates the website and makes it available on this domain name.\n4. The client uses the website and tells the chatbot: add this, replace replace this with that, etc.",

Already millions are in their community where they can take any app and remix it. \n\nWhat caught my eye? Is how YouWare improves your prompts automatically. Who needs a prompt engineer? Not me. \n\nWe cover a lot in this 47 minute conversation. Don't have time? Ask Grok \"what will I learn by watching this.\"\n\nI'm judging their hackathon today and one of the developers used it to recreate MySpace. Now that's fun! What will you do with it?

      "content": "MIRI is the organization that I founded in 2000.  In the old days it did most of the deep theory on alignment research, if you filter out the wacky optimistic hopium. MIRI is approximately the only organized group on the planet where you can ask \"So what goes wrong if you just try training an AI to do nice things and then make it be superintelligent?\", and get back a long list of technical issues that distinguishes deep problems from shallow problems; as opposed to getting back \"Nothing will go wrong and it'll work great!\" or \"Well, you've got to probe the activations to see if it's plotting against you,\" or \"Why, who could possibly predict *that* in advance, we'll just have to try it and see if it goes great!\"\n\nMIRI is what supported me and Nate Soares through writing the NYT bestselling \"If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies\". MIRI continues to support Nate and others as they run around Washington DC trying to talk to representatives and senators and staff about the importance of the United States not dying -- the way we'd all die if anyone, anywhere on Earth, inside or outside the United States, tried to build something vastly smarter than themselves and of course lost control of it.\n\nThere are mostly not other people doing exactly this job, because it is not an easy road to funding or political power, compared to flogging \"what if China gets it first\", or regional problems like datacenters consuming electricity. This means we rely on YOU -- among others, yes, but also YOU - to fund this work continuing. We are not fundraising powerhouses; in 2021 we surprisingly and unusually got a couple of crypto donations totaling $21M, and we used this to focus on doing our jobs and executing some sharp difficult pivots instead of fundraising over the next few years. Our end-of-2025 fundraiser is the first one we've run since then.\n\nAs with any other 501c3, federal law says that MIRI's status as a public charity depends on us being supported by \"the public\" rather than single large donors. This means that your small donations to us have an outsized effect *even though* they will in fact be dwarfed by the donations of a few people who can afford to donate seven figures. The rules and the laws are set up to make your smaller donations count.\n\nWe are trying to fill a matching grant from the Survival and Flourishing Fund which has $0.95M of $1.6M to go, and runs until the end of the year. For perspective, that's less than 0.1% of what Mark Zuckerberg is willing to spend on one researcher who'll help destroy the world. Destroying the world is easy and cheap and pays off big money in the short term -- before of course we all die, in what's increasingly looking like it might also possibly be a fairly short term.\n\nWe are trying to figure out how to spend *more* money. Even if you look at our full fundraiser rather than the short-term SFF matching grant, it is an embarrassingly small amount of money to be trying to raise while the world is ending and banks with it. Alas, it is not that easy to spend money in useful ways if you demand that it actually be useful; and that has always been the distinguishing feature of MIRI as an organization, among an increasingly crowded field of imitators.\n\nSo! Please donate an additional $1M before the end of the year. While we do not promise that this will prevent machine superintelligence from eating Earth and its surrounding galaxies, we will try to only do things which make this less likely rather than more likely; and in the meanwhile and regardless, say things that are true rather than false.\n\nhttps://t.co/bh3Ye48Dfr",

MIRI currently has an easier time drawing on large donors than Lightcone does.  Lightcone has less money left in the bank.  So I'd say, pick Lightcone first, even though their SFF match is less per dollar (1:8 rather than 1:1).  (There are likewise complicated arguments against *that* sort of thing; I think those arguments are also wrong.  I nonetheless carefully inform potential large donors I talk to that donating to MIRI may cause some smaller donations to reflow to Lightcone, in case they turn out to hugely care, because be it far from me to blindside anyone about that sort of thing.  So far it has not been a big deal to any of them.)",

      "content": "Just 20 Minutes of High Intensity Intervals: Study Finds Sprint-Level Effort Activates Cellular Cleanup @WomensHealthMag @Nature \n\nA recent Large Scale machine learning study in Nature Communications found that short bursts of sprinting rejuvenated cellular components more effectively than traditional moderate cardio.\n\nHigh-intensity cycling sprints were shown to handle malfunctioning mitochondria and promote the development and maintenance of healthy area.\n\nExperts indicate that even brief, infrequent sessions—just a few minutes a couple of times per week—can produce these benefits.\n\nWhen you’re running or cycling, pushing yourself to sprint for short intervals could help your body repair and regenerate cells, leading to improved cellular performance and increased energy.\n\nAlthough the study, featured in Nature Communications, involved a limited number of participants, it highlights the potential health advantages of high-speed activity. Here’s a summary of the findings and expert advice on the topic.\n\nMeet the expert: Javier Botella, PhD, is the lead study author and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Health and Sport (IHES) @ Victoria University. Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, is the co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab.\n\nPhysical activity is known to support mitochondrial health, but the specific cellular changes caused by different exercise routines are still being explored. In this study, researchers compared short, intense sprints with moderate, continuous workouts in a randomized controlled trial. The results showed that sprint intervals triggered stress responses and cellular pathways that help repair and maintain mitochondria. While moderate training increased the amount and activity of mitochondria, sprint training enhanced their function and improved related metabolic processes. These insights help clarify how workout intensity can influence cellular health and could guide personalized exercise plans. \n\nAccording to Botella, this process allows the body to clear out older or less efficient parts within cells. He compares it to tossing out damaged furniture from your home. In this case, faulty mitochondria from your cells that cannot withstand the demands of sprinting are handled.\n\nWhile sprinting puts considerable pressure on your cells’ mitochondria, this is mostly beneficial. Botella notes that about 10-15% of mitochondria are unable to cope with this strain and become damaged as a result.\n\nAs these mitochondria are impaired during sprints, your body initiates processes to remove the damaged ones and foster the growth of healthier replacements. This means the remaining mitochondria are better equipped to supply your cells with energy.\n\nThough extensive sprinting isn’t necessary, the research supports including occasional high-intensity intervals in your routine to promote cellular health.\n\nBotella emphasizes that while most forms of exercise enhance mitochondria and cardiovascular health, incorporating sprints or intense sessions occasionally can help eliminate weaker mitochondria, making room for newer, more effective ones.\n\nAlbert Matheny, RD, CSCS, also recommends including brief bursts of speed in your workouts. He advises reaching at least 80% of your maximum heart rate (or an effort level of about eight out of ten) two or three times per week. This could involve multiple one-minute sprints on a treadmill or bike, each followed by two minutes of walking to recover. Beginners should gradually increase intensity and consult with a physician if they have existing health issues.\n\nYou’ll Keep Burning Calories Even After You Finish This 20-Minute HIIT Workout\n\nReferences \n\nBotella, J., Perri, E., Caruana, N.

      "content": "There are 4.5 million attacks by dogs in the US every year, roughly 12k per day, of which about 2k need medical attention. Yes, the majority of those dog attacks seem to be related to pitbulls, but don’t discount all the other breeds either. I’ve dealt with way too many irresponsible owners letting their dogs off the leash and aggressively accost others. It’s especially frightening when that happens around small children. “He’s just being friendly!” is utter BS and these owners should know better. My take on dogs is that dogs are weapons. Yes, they can be wonderful and extremely fulfilling companions, but they need to be treated like weapons by the law. Which means when taken outside they absolutely need to be on a leash, except in specially designated areas or in the wilderness. In urban areas leash laws should be extremely aggressively enforced. An attack by a dog should be treated as an aggravated assault with a weapon and the owner of the dog should be treated accordingly by the law.",
