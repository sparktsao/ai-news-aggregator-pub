The scene should immediately convey the themes of the day's news to readers.\n\n## The Mascot (CRITICAL)\nThe attached image shows our skunk mascot. You MUST:\n- Keep the EXACT circuit board pattern on the skunk's body and tail - this is a core part of the brand identity\n- Maintain the skunk's white and black coloring with the tech circuit pattern visible\n- The skunk must be ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING related to the topics - typing on a keyboard, reading papers, adjusting equipment, pointing at a screen, holding tools, etc. NOT just standing and smiling at the camera!\n- Position the skunk in the lower-left or lower-right portion, engaged with the scene\n\n## Today's Stories\n\n**Topic 1: AI Safety & Emergent Behaviors**\nResearch revealed critical alignment challenges: warning-framed training data paradoxically teaches warned-against behaviors at a 76.7% reproduction rate. Studies on emergent persuasion showed LLMs persuade without explicit prompting, shifting threat models from misuse to emergent behaviors. The TRAP benchmark found web agents including GPT-5 remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, while practical challenges in control monitoring for frontier AI were documented.\n**Topic 2: Coding Agents & Developer Productivity**\nGreg Brockman shared tips on leveraging coding agents to ship fast, generating massive engagement. Andrew Ng promoted his Claude Code course with Anthropic that reached 791K views, while Jerry Liu argued that filesystem-equipped agents eliminate RAG needs. On Reddit, an Anthropic engineer's claim that Claude Code wrote 100% of his contributions sparked intense debate about AI self-improvement capabilities.\n**Topic 3: Open Source Model Releases**\nAn unreleased Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct was discovered extracted from Meta's API, exciting the local inference community. Tencent released WeDLM-8B, a diffusion language model running 3-6x faster than traditional approaches. Korean labs coordinated releases including Naver's HyperCLOVA X SEED with unified multimodal capabilities, while Neel Nanda at DeepMind released activation oracles for Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 to advance interpretability research.\n**Topic 4: LLM Training Breakthroughs**\nTrust Region Masking achieved tighter bounds for long-horizon RL with O(T^{3/2}) versus classical O(T²). Research proved that training-inference mismatch in LLM RL causes systematically biased gradients, addressable via dynamic vocabulary pruning. A surprising finding showed training on incorrect CoT traces from capable models can improve reasoning, suggesting distribution shape matters more than correctness.\n**Topic 5: Meta AI Ecosystem Expansion**\nMeta acquired Manus, the AI agent company, signaling continued consolidation in the AI agent space. Separately, an unreleased Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct model was discovered extracted from Meta's API, with GGUF quantizations quickly made available by the community. These developments highlight Meta's dual strategy of acquisitions and open-weight model releases.\n**Topic 6: AI Predictions Reality Check**\nA viral thread catalogued failed 2025 predictions: junior devs weren't replaced, prompt engineers didn't become highest-paid, and autonomous agents remained limited. Ethan Mollick argued that being pro-AI or anti-AI is a category error when evidence supports both views. On Reddit, growing backlash against AI slop revealed community tension about perceptions of AI-generated content, with users calling human-AI collaborative work dismissively.\n\n## Visual Direction\nCreate a scene that represents these stories. You must include Topic 1 (the top story), then pick 2-3 others that would make the best scene together. Consider:\n- What visual metaphors could represent these themes?\n- How can the skunk mascot interact with or observe these elements?\n- Suggested scene elements: shield icons, protective barriers, guardrails, autonomous systems, workflow diagrams, connected tools, neural network visualization, glowing nodes, architecture, compute clusters, gradient flows, learning curves\n\n## Style Requirements\n- Playful cartoon illustration, tech editorial art style\n- Vibrant colors with Trend Red (#E63946) accents\n- Energetic, forward-looking, tech-optimistic mood\n- No Trend Micro logos or watermarks - but other company logos (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) are encouraged when relevant to the stories",

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.",

When $\\pi_{\\text{roll}} \\ne \\pi_{\\theta}$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.",

          "content": "We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.",

          "content": "Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.",

Prior work has explored control monitoring in simplified settings, but scaling monitoring to real-world deployments introduces additional dynamics: parallel agent instances, non-negligible oversight latency, incremental attacks between agent instances, and the difficulty of identifying scheming agents based on individual harmful actions. In this paper, we analyse design choices to address these challenges, focusing on three forms of monitoring with different latency-safety trade-offs: synchronous, semi-synchronous, and asynchronous monitoring. We introduce a high-level safety case sketch as a tool for understanding and comparing these monitoring protocols. Our analysis identifies three challenges -- oversight, latency, and recovery -- and explores them in four case studies of possible future AI deployments.",

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $\\mu$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.",

          "content": "With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.",

It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.",

All runs are trained on an environment with a reward hacking loophole except for the RL baseline, which is trained on a no-loophole environment. Statistical significance compared to the RL baseline is indicated by * for values greater and † for values lesser at ɑ=0.01.

          "content": "Another year of rapid AI advances has created more opportunities than ever for anyone — including those just entering the field — to build software. In fact, many companies just can’t find enough skilled AI talent. Every winter holiday, I spend some time learning and building, and I hope you will too. This helps me sharpen old skills and learn new ones, and it can help you grow your career in tech.\n\nTo be skilled at building AI systems, I recommend that you:\n- Take AI courses\n- Practice building AI systems\n- (Optionally) read research papers\n\nLet me share why each of these is important.\n\nI’ve heard some developers advise others to just plunge into building things without worrying about learning. This is bad advice! Unless you’re already surrounded by a community of experienced AI developers, plunging into building without understanding the foundations of AI means you’ll risk reinventing the wheel or — more likely — reinventing the wheel badly!\n\nFor example, during interviews with job candidates, I have spoken with developers who reinvented standard RAG document chunking strategies, duplicated existing evaluation techniques for Agentic AI, or ended up with messy LLM context management code. If they had taken a couple of relevant courses, they would have better understood the building blocks that already exist. They could still rebuild these blocks from scratch if they wished, or perhaps even invent something superior to existing solutions, but they would have avoided weeks of unnecessary work. So structured learning is important. Moreover, I find taking courses really fun. Rather than watching Netflix, I prefer watching a course by a knowledgeable AI instructor any day!\n\nAt the same time, taking courses alone isn’t enough. There are many lessons that you’ll gain only from hands-on practice. Learning the theory behind how an airplane works is very important to becoming a pilot, but no one has ever learned to be a pilot just by taking courses. At some point, jumping into the pilot's seat is critical! The good news is that by learning to use highly agentic coders, the process of building is the easiest it has ever been. And learning about AI building blocks might inspire you with new ideas for things to build. If I’m not feeling inspired about what projects to work on, I will usually either take courses or read research papers, and after doing this for a while, I always end up with many new ideas. Moreover, I find building really fun, and I hope you will too.\n\nFinally, not everyone has to do this, but I find that many of the strongest candidates on the job market today at least occasionally read research papers. While I find research papers much harder to digest than courses, they contain a lot of knowledge that has not yet been translated to easier-to-understand formats. I put this much lower priority than either taking courses or practicing building, but if you have an opportunity to strengthen your ability to read papers, I urge you to do so too. I find taking courses and building to be fun, and reading papers can be more of a grind, but the flashes of insight I get from reading papers are delightful.\n\nHave a wonderful winter holiday and a Happy New Year. In addition to learning and building, I hope you'll spend time with loved ones — that, too, is important!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/MaWDs0AbzG ]",

(I think, anyways)\n\nFacebook has a [Llama API](https://llama.developer.meta.com) available that allows for inference of the other Llama models (L3.3 70B, L4 Scout and Maverick), but *also* includes a special, new (according to the original press release) \"Llama 3.3 8B\" that didn't exist anywhere else and was stuck behind the Facebook API!\n\nHowever. The Llama API supports finetuning L3.3... *and downloading the final model in HF format.* Problem solved, right?\n\nWellllllllllllllll. Not really. The finetuning API was hidden behind layers of support tickets. I tried when the original API dropped in April, and was just told \"We'll think about it and send you any updates\" (there never were any updates).\n\nFlash forward to December, on a whim I decide to look at the API again. And... by god... the finetuning tab was there. I could click on it and start a job (please ignore that I have no idea how it works, and in fact the finetuning tab actually disappeared after the first time I clicked on it, though I could still manually go to the page).\n\nApparently, this was not very well tested, as there were a good few bugs, the UI was janky, and the download model function did not actually work due to CORS (I had to manually curl things to get the CDN link).\n\nBut... by god... the zip file downloaded, and I had my slightly finetuned model.\n\nTo my shock and delight, however, they also provide the adapter that they merged into the model. That means I can *subtract* that adapter and get the original model. And... here we are!\n\n",

          "title": "I made Soprano-80M: Stream ultra-realistic TTS in &lt;15ms, up to 2000x realtime, and &lt;1 GB VRAM, released under Apache 2.0!",
          "content": "Hi! I’m Eugene, and I’ve been working on **Soprano**: a new state-of-the-art TTS model I designed for voice chatbots. Voice applications require very low latency and natural speech generation to sound convincing, and I created Soprano to deliver on both of these goals.\n\nSoprano is the world’s fastest TTS by an enormous margin. It is optimized to stream audio playback with **&lt;15 ms latency, 10x faster than any other realtime TTS models** like Chatterbox Turbo, VibeVoice-Realtime, GLM TTS, or CosyVoice3. It also natively supports batched inference, benefiting greatly from long-form speech generation. **I was able to generate a 10-hour audiobook in under 20 seconds, achieving \\~2000x realtime!** This is multiple orders of magnitude faster than any other TTS model, making ultra-fast, ultra-natural TTS a reality for the first time.\n\nI owe these gains to the following design choices:\n\n1. **Higher sample rate:** Soprano natively generates 32 kHz audio, which sounds much sharper and clearer than other models. In fact, 32 kHz speech sounds indistinguishable from 44.1/48 kHz speech, so I found it to be the best choice.\n2. **Vocoder-based audio decoder:** Most TTS designs use diffusion models to convert LLM outputs into audio waveforms, but this is slow. I use a vocoder-based decoder instead, which runs several orders of magnitude faster (\\~6000x realtime!), enabling extremely fast audio generation.\n3. **Seamless Streaming:** Streaming usually requires generating multiple audio chunks and applying crossfade. However, this causes streamed output to sound worse than nonstreamed output. Soprano produces streaming output that is identical to unstreamed output, and can start streaming audio after generating just five audio tokens with the LLM.\n4. **State-of-the-art Neural Audio Codec:** Speech is represented using a novel neural codec that compresses audio to \\~15 tokens/sec at just 0.2 kbps. This is the highest bitrate compression achieved by any audio codec.\n5. **Infinite generation length:** Soprano automatically generates each sentence independently, and then stitches the results together. Splitting by sentences dramatically improving inference speed. \n\nI’m planning multiple updates to Soprano, including improving the model’s stability and releasing its training code. I’ve also had a lot of helpful support from the community on adding new inference modes, which will be integrated soon!\n\nThis is the first release of Soprano, so I wanted to start small. Soprano was only pretrained on 1000 hours of audio (\\~100x less than other TTS models), so its stability and quality will improve tremendously as I train it on more data. Also, I optimized Soprano purely for speed, which is why it lacks bells and whistles like voice cloning, style control, and multilingual support. Now that I have experience creating TTS models, I have a lot of ideas for how to make Soprano even better in the future, so stay tuned for those!\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano](https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano)\n\nHuggingface Demo: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS)\n\nModel Weights: [https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M](https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M)\n\n\\- Eugene",
