(I think, anyways)\n\nFacebook has a [Llama API](https://llama.developer.meta.com) available that allows for inference of the other Llama models (L3.3 70B, L4 Scout and Maverick), but *also* includes a special, new (according to the original press release) \"Llama 3.3 8B\" that didn't exist anywhere else and was stuck behind the Facebook API!\n\nHowever. The Llama API supports finetuning L3.3... *and downloading the final model in HF format.* Problem solved, right?\n\nWellllllllllllllll. Not really. The finetuning API was hidden behind layers of support tickets. I tried when the original API dropped in April, and was just told \"We'll think about it and send you any updates\" (there never were any updates).\n\nFlash forward to December, on a whim I decide to look at the API again. And... by god... the finetuning tab was there. I could click on it and start a job (please ignore that I have no idea how it works, and in fact the finetuning tab actually disappeared after the first time I clicked on it, though I could still manually go to the page).\n\nApparently, this was not very well tested, as there were a good few bugs, the UI was janky, and the download model function did not actually work due to CORS (I had to manually curl things to get the CDN link).\n\nBut... by god... the zip file downloaded, and I had my slightly finetuned model.\n\nTo my shock and delight, however, they also provide the adapter that they merged into the model. That means I can *subtract* that adapter and get the original model. And... here we are!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi! I\u2019m Eugene, and I\u2019ve been working on\u00a0**Soprano**: a new state-of-the-art TTS model I designed for voice chatbots. Voice applications require very low latency and natural speech generation to sound convincing, and I created Soprano to deliver on both of these goals.\n\nSoprano is the world\u2019s fastest TTS by an enormous margin. It is optimized to stream audio playback with\u00a0**&lt;15 ms latency, 10x faster than any other realtime TTS models** like Chatterbox Turbo, VibeVoice-Realtime, GLM TTS, or CosyVoice3. It also natively supports batched inference, benefiting greatly from long-form speech generation.\u00a0**I was able to generate a 10-hour audiobook in under 20 seconds, achieving \\~2000x realtime!**\u00a0This is multiple orders of magnitude faster than any other TTS model, making ultra-fast, ultra-natural TTS a reality for the first time.\n\nI owe these gains to the following design choices:\n\n1. **Higher sample rate:**\u00a0Soprano natively generates 32 kHz audio, which sounds much sharper and clearer than other models. In fact, 32 kHz speech sounds indistinguishable from 44.1/48 kHz speech, so I found it to be the best choice.\n2. **Vocoder-based audio decoder:**\u00a0Most TTS designs use diffusion models to convert LLM outputs into audio waveforms, but this is slow. I use a vocoder-based decoder instead, which runs several orders of magnitude faster (\\~6000x realtime!), enabling extremely fast audio generation.\n3. **Seamless Streaming:**\u00a0Streaming usually requires generating multiple audio chunks and applying crossfade. However, this causes streamed output to sound worse than nonstreamed output. Soprano produces streaming output that is identical to unstreamed output, and can start streaming audio after generating just five audio tokens with the LLM.\n4. **State-of-the-art Neural Audio Codec:**\u00a0Speech is represented using a novel neural codec that compresses audio to \\~15 tokens/sec at just 0.2 kbps. This is the highest bitrate compression achieved by any audio codec.\n5. **Infinite generation length:**\u00a0Soprano automatically generates each sentence independently, and then stitches the results together. Splitting by sentences dramatically improving inference speed.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m planning multiple updates to Soprano, including improving the model\u2019s stability and releasing its training code. I\u2019ve also had a lot of helpful support from the community on adding new inference modes, which will be integrated soon!\n\nThis is the first release of Soprano, so I wanted to start small. Soprano was only pretrained on 1000 hours of audio (\\~100x less than other TTS models), so its stability and quality will improve tremendously as I train it on more data. Also, I optimized Soprano purely for speed, which is why it lacks bells and whistles like voice cloning, style control, and multilingual support. Now that I have experience creating TTS models, I have a lot of ideas for how to make Soprano even better in the future, so stay tuned for those!\n\nGithub:\u00a0[https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano](https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano)\n\nHuggingface Demo:\u00a0[https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS)\n\nModel Weights:\u00a0[https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M](https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M)\n\n\\- Eugene",

The details of how I trained it are [here](https://zenodo.org/records/18086776) and a demo can be found [here](https://x.com/mwebazarick/status/2005643851655168146?s=12). I am open to any feedback that you are willing to share because I am going to continue working on improving BULaMU-Dream.

      "content": "I wanted to share a pattern I\u2019ve been noticing with GPT (especially GPT-5.2) and see if anyone else is experiencing the same thing.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s bothering me isn\u2019t \u201cthe model getting a fact wrong\u201d or \u201cnot being able to do X.\u201d That\u2019s normal, it\u2019s a probabilistic model and it can miss. What bothers me is the default tone, especially when the conversation touches even slightly on everyday frustration or anything mildly emotional. The chat turns into an automatic emotional protocol, even when I\u2019m just talking normally.\n\n\n\nAnd that ends up ruining the main point of the product: conversation (because it\u2019s \u201cChat\u201dGPT, lol).\n\n\n\nThree patterns I keep seeing all the time:\n\n1. Automatic emotional framing (the model assumes your mental state) Instead of responding to the content of what I said, the model often starts by stating how I\u2019m feeling: \u201cI get why you\u2019re pissed,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re indignant,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re spiraling,\u201d etc. But I didn\u2019t say that. A lot of the time I\u2019m just being ironic, complaining about something silly, or describing a situation and I want an objective answer. Then the conversation derails and turns into \u201clet\u2019s work through your emotional state.\u201d\n2. Therapeutic language and unsolicited validation It\u2019s very common for it to throw in lines like: \u201cit\u2019s not silly,\u201d \u201cyour feelings are real,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not broken,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not crazy,\u201d \u201cyour feelings are valid\u201d\u2026 Sure, this can be useful in specific contexts, but in everyday use it becomes intrusive, condescending, and honestly weird. Instead of feeling like a conversation between adults, it feels like scripted emotional support (I literally already have a therapist, so a chatbot trying to play therapist is insane).\n3. Relativizing language and euphemisms that shift the conversation There are certain constructions that show up constantly: \u201cit sounds like\u2026,\u201d \u201cfrom X\u2019s point of view\u2026,\u201d \u201cif it helps\u2026,\u201d \u201cit may have been understood that way\u2026\u201d In practice, this weakens what was said, reduces objectivity, and sometimes creates a sense of evasion (which a lot of users are calling GPT-5.2\u2019s \u201cgaslighting\u201d). When this happens repeatedly, it feels like emotional framing is being pushed on top of the conversation.\n\n\n\nWhy is this a real problem? Because it changes the product\u2019s behavior. ChatGPT stops being a useful conversational assistant, the way it has been marketed since launch, and turns into an always-on emotional containment protocol, even when there\u2019s no crisis. The result is more friction, less clarity, and you start feeling like you have to walk on eggshells just to get a normal response.\n\n\n\nThe wildest part: this is the default in 5.2 if you don\u2019t personalize it and use persistent memory to avoid it. When I force instructions for a more direct style, the chat becomes much more human, less defensive, and more fluid. But by default, it feels like anything with even a hint of emotion pushes the model into this automatic \u201csupportive\u201d mode or an extremely defensive mode, as if everyone starts from \u201cyou\u2019re a potential threat.\u201d\n\n4. What I think would be healthier (for the product and for conversation)\n\na) The default should respond to content first, objectively.\n\nb) Emotional-support language only when the user asks for it, or when there are clear, direct indicators of risk (because the current signal detection seems really off).\n\nc) Stop presuming mental states and stop automatic validation in everyday conversation.\n\nd) Less \u201cit sounds like\u201d and fewer euphemisms that shift responsibility onto the user and add noise.\n\n\n\nI keep thinking that users who have no idea how to personalize GPT with instructions and persistent memory (which is probably most everyday users) must get really stressed by this. At this point, my memory is basically reserved for \u201cfixing\u201d the model rather than things I actually want memory for.\n\n\n\nIs anyone else feeling like GPT-5.2 has become \u201crobotic-therapeutic\u201d?  \nAnd if so, have you found any configuration/instruction that genuinely improves it without turning your instructions into a thesis? Mine are already packed, and my memory is probably going to end up the same way.",

      "content": "I was benchmarking my local llm collection to get an idea of tokens rates. I thought it might be interesting to compare CUDA vs Vulkan on my 3080 10GB. As expected, in almost all cases CUDA was the better option as far as token rate However, I found one suprise that affects a small number of models.\n\nDisclaimer: take the following results with a pinch of salt. I'm not a statistician nor mathmetician. I have been programming for some decades but this test code is mostly deslopped jive code. YMMV.\n\nThe main findings is that when running certain models partially offloaded to GPU, some models perform much better on Vulkan than CUDA:\n\n- GLM4 9B Q6 had a 2.2x speedup on PP, and 1.7x speedup on TG\n- Qwen3 8B Q6 had a 1.5x speedup on PP, and 1.1x speedup on PP (meh)\n- and Ministral3 14B 2512 Q4 had a 4.4x speedup on PP, and a 1.6x speedup on TG\n\nedit: should add my setup: using latest llama.cpp build.

If you're doing that solely because you prefer the aesthetics of Z-Image-Turbo, then carry on.\n\nBut for those who may be doing this out of perceived resource constraints, you may benefit from knowing that you can train LoRAs for Wan 2.2 in `ostris/ai-toolkit` with 16GB VRAM. Just start with the default 24GB config file and then add these parameters to your config under the `model` section:\n\n```\nlayer_offloading: true\nlayer_offloading_text_encoder_percent: 0.6\nlayer_offloading_transformer_percent: 0.6\n```\n\nYou can lower or raise the offloading percent to find what works for your setup. Of course, your batch size, gradient accumulation, and resolution all have to be reasonable as well (e.g., I did `batch_size: 2`, `gradient_accumulation: 2`, `resolution: 512`).\n\nI've only tested two different LoRA runs for Wan 2.2, but so far it trains easier and, IMO, looks more natural than Z-Image-Turbo, which tends to look like it's *trying* to look realistic and gritty.",

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture \u2013 a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model\u2019s initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7\u00d7 faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.",

It tries its best to dig recursively through node graphs to find the actual prompts and models.\n* **Privacy Scrubber:** There is a specific tab to strip all metadata (EXIF, PNG chunks, workflow graphs) so you can share images cleanly without leaking your workflow.\n* **Local Favorites:** You can save images to a local \"library\" inside the app. It makes a full-quality copy of the file, so you don't lose the metadata even if you delete the original generation from your output folder.\n* **Raw Inspector:** If a workflow is really complex, you can view the raw JSON tree to debug custom nodes.\n\n**Tech Stack:** It\u2019s a native desktop application built with JavaFX. I know Java isn't everyone's favorite, but it allows the app to be snappy and work cross-platform. It\u2019s packaged as a portable `.exe` for Windows, so no installation is required\u2014just unzip and run.\n\n**License:** MIT (Free for everything, code is on GitHub).\n\n**Link:** [GitHub Repository &amp; Download](https://github.com/erroralex/metadata-viewer) *(Direct download is under \"Releases\" on the right side)*\n\nThis is v1.0, so there might still be some edge cases with very obscure custom nodes that I haven't tested yet. If you try it out, I\u2019d appreciate any feedback or bug reports!\n\nThanks!\n\n**EDIT (v1.0.3 Update):** Thanks for all the feedback! I've just pushed a major update based on your suggestions:\n\n* **Resizable Window:** The app is no longer locked to a specific size\u2014you can now resize and maximize it freely!\n* **Better LoRA Detection:** Now fully supports **Forge** &amp; **A1111** LoRA tags in prompts, plus correct strength values for complex ComfyUI workflows.\n* **UI Polish:** Added proper window controls and smoother resizing.\n\nGrab the latest version on GitHub!\n\n**EDIT 2 (v1.0.7 Update):** I've just released another big update adding features you guys requested!\n\n* **Speed Sorter:** A brand new view designed for rapid culling. You can now select an input folder and use keys `1`\\-`5` to instantly **move** images into specific target folders, or `Space` to skip. Includes a fullscreen mode for checking details before sorting.\n* **Fully Portable:** The app now stores your \"Favorites\" library and thumbnails inside a local `data/` folder next to the executable (instead of your user profile). You can now put the app on a USB stick and take your library with you.\n* **Qwen &amp; UI Fixes:** Improved parsing for complex workflows (specifically Qwen nodes and reference-based sizing), fixed layout issues for long seeds, and unified the dark theme.\n\nYou can grab the new zip from the \"Releases\" section on GitHub!",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been using `Qwen-Image-Edit-2511` and started noticing strange hallucinations and consistency issues with certain prompts. I realized that switching from the default 1024x1024 (1MP) square resolution to non-square aspect ratios produced vastly different (and better) results.\n\nTo confirm this wasn't just a quantization or LoRA issue, I rented an H200 to run the full unquantized BF16 model. The results were consistent across all tests: **Square aspect ratios break the model's coherence.**\n\n**The Findings (See attached images):**\n\n* **Image 1: ComfyUI +** [FP8 Lightning ](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Lightning/blob/main/qwen_image_edit_2511_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled_lightning_comfyui.safetensors)\\- Using the [official workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/workflow_templates/refs/heads/main/templates/image_qwen_image_edit_2511.json), the square outputs (1024x1024 and 1288x1288) struggle with the anime style transformation, looking washed out or hallucinating background details. The non-square versions (832x1216) are crisp and faithful to the source.\n* **Image 2:** [Diffusers Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image?tab=readme-ov-file#qwen-image-edit-2511-for-image-editing-multiple-image-support-and-improved-consistency) **+ BF16 Lightning LoRA -** Running the official Diffusers pipeline on an H200 yielded the same issue. The square outputs lose the subject's likeness significantly. However, the non-square output resulted in an almost perfect zero-shift edit (as seen in the grayscale overlay).\n* **Image 3: Full Model (BF16) - No LoRA -** Even running the full model at 40 steps (CFG 4.0), the square output is completely degraded compared to the portrait aspect ratio. This proves the issue lies within the base model or the training data distribution, not the Lightning extraction.\n* **Image 4,5,6**: Square outputs in different resolutions\n   * Image 4 is on the recommended 1:1 (1328x1328)\n* **Image 7**: 2k Portrait output\n* Image 8: Original input image\n\nThe results without the lightning lora proves there is some problem with the base model or the inference code when square resolutions are used. Also tried changing the input resolution from 1MP up to 2MP and it does not fix the issue.\n\nFor more common editing tasks usually it doesn't happen, this is probably why we don't see people talking about this. We also noticed that when re-creating scenes or merging two characters on the same image the results are massively better if the output is not square as well.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this with different prompts ?",

While scanning attn\\_out, I identified a persistent hidden dimension (dim 3039) that appeared repeatedly across prompts. I'll spare you all the Gradio screenshots, there are quite a few.\n\nInitial probing suggested a loose \u201cexpressive vs constrained\u201d effect, but that interpretation didn\u2019t hold up under tighter controls. I then ran more systematic tests across:\n\n* multiple prompt types (social, procedural, factual, preference-based)\n* early / mid / late layers\n* both positive and negative intervention\n* long generations (1024 tokens)\n* repeated runs when results were ambiguous\n\nAcross all of these conditions, **the only stable, cross-prompt effect** was a change in the model\u2019s *degree of commitment* to its current generative trajectory.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* Increasing intervention magnitude (regardless of sign) caused the model to respond **more confidently and decisively**\n* This did **not** correlate with improved factual accuracy\n* In some cases (especially early-layer intervention), higher intervention increased **confident hallucination**\n* Constrained procedural prompts (e.g. PB&amp;J instructions) showed minimal variation, while open-ended prompts (e.g. greetings, blog-style responses) showed much larger stylistic and tonal shifts\n\nThe effect appears to modulate **how strongly the model commits to whatever path it has already sampled**, rather than influencing *which* path is chosen. This shows up as:\n\n* reduced hedging\n* increased assertiveness\n* stronger persistence of narrative frame\n* less self-correction once a trajectory is underway\n\nImportantly, this dimension does **not** behave like:\n\n* a semantic feature\n* an emotion representation\n* a creativity or verbosity knob\n* a factual reasoning mechanism\n\nA more accurate framing is that it functions as a **global commitment / epistemic certainty gain**, influencing how readily the model doubles down on its internal state.\n\nThis also explains earlier inconsistencies:\n\n* early-layer interventions affect task framing (sometimes badly)\n* later-layer interventions affect delivery and tone\n* highly constrained tasks limit the observable effect\n* magnitude matters more than direction\n\nAt this stage, the claim is intentionally narrow.\n\nEdit: adjusted punctuation.\n\nNext steps (not yet done) include residual-stream analysis to see whether this feature accumulates across layers, and ablation tests to check whether removing it increases hedging and self-revision.",

Analysis reveals that leading models have improved by an average of 2.5 IQ points per month since May 2024, a compounding rate that suggests the human-level baseline will rapidly fall behind AI. The ecosystem is diversifying as it accelerates. Chinese model GLM-4.7 has taken the top open-weight spot on the Artificial Analysis leaderboard, while South Korea's Naver launched HyperCLOVA X SEED Think, a 32B model that outperforms Gemini 3 Pro on agentic tool use. The workflow of the master craftsman has already dissolved. Andrej Karpathy reports that Claude now conducts all optimization experiments for his \"nanochat\" project, keeping him in the recursive self-improvement loop of a process he used to drive manually. We are engineering a synthetic prefrontal cortex. Chinese researchers have proposed a \"System 3\" architecture that grafts an outer self-improvement loop onto LLMs, achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps. Even the smallest circuits are waking up. Enthusiasts have compressed a language model onto a Z80 chip with 64-KB RAM. Furthermore, researchers found that diffusion models generate quality samples before they memorize, suggesting that for some synthetic minds, imagination is computationally cheaper than memory.\n\nThe geography of intellect is consolidating. Analysis of NeurIPS 2025 papers shows cutting-edge research is now almost exclusively shaped in Beijing, Shanghai, and San Francisco. Deep learning is beginning to industrialize the production of mathematical proof. Terry Tao has started cataloging AI's contribution to Erd\u0151s problems, documenting 48 full solutions, 32 partial results, and 7 failures. After all, a single human proof is genius, but a million AI proofs are a statistic. We are also finding our reflection in the weights. Oxford researchers discovered that humans and transformers share similar learning dynamics when generalizing rules.\n\nHardware is being reorganized around the specific bottlenecks of the transformer. Nvidia is reportedly planning to integrate Groq\u2019s LPU units into its 2028 Feynman GPUs, stacking inference speed directly onto training might. The supply chain is tightening. TSMC is raising 2-nm prices for the next four years in the face of explosive demand. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is discussing a 2.5-D manufacturing line in Indiana, the first of its kind in the US, to counter TSMC's AI chip packaging monopoly. Infrastructure is continuing to scale massively. Epoch AI predicts OpenAI will dominate global AI data center capacity by 2027, while SoftBank is nearing a deal to acquire DigitalBridge for its $108 billion in infrastructure assets.\n\nThe surveillance state is becoming automated and airborne. In China, police drones are reportedly issuing tickets for texting while driving, while other UAVs deploy Blade Runner-style \"flying TVs\" with ultra-light LED screens. The battlefield looks increasingly robotic. China is showcasing armed combat robot dogs, though developers warn that humanoid robots can now be hacked via voice commands. Construction is becoming a mere print job. Dusty Robotics robots have now laid out 200 million square feet of floor plans directly from CAD. Mobility is being refactored into a service layer. Dubai is launching Joby air taxis in 2026, finally delivering the flying cars of the future, while Tesla FSD is becoming a budget ambulance service for the injured. Even the grid is catching up. Global renewable capacity grew by an average 30% per year over the past three years, putting the world within reach of the goal set at COP 28 to triple clean power by 2030.\n\nWe are acquiring root access to the biological operating system. Harvard researchers introduced DNA-Diffusion, an AI that designs synthetic switches to turn genes on in specific cell types. We are mapping the hardware of instinct. Researchers discovered that pigeons have a \"vestibular-mesopallial circuit\" that allows them to \"hear\" magnetic fields. Even neurodiversity is being traced to the receptor level. Yale identified a glutamate receptor deficit in autistic brains.\n\nThe economy is adjusting to post-human inputs. Since the GENIUS Act\u2019s passage in July, stablecoins have  hit $300 billion in circulation, and are now projected by the US Treasury to reach $2 trillion. Meanwhile, hotels are fighting a rearguard action against AI travel agents that threaten to commoditize their brands. In light of the growing post-human economy, education pioneer Sal Khan is  advocating for a 1% profit pledge to retrain the AI-displaced.\n\nThe Solar System is beginning to make itself more useful. Physicists propose that Ganymede\u2019s ancient surface may record detectable scars of dark-matter impacts. Even the compute frontier is leaving the ground. Analysis suggests orbital AI inference will collapse to 1/1000th the cost of ground-based compute by the 2030s.\n\nThis is the scene right before the Dyson Swarm shows up early.",

      "content": "https://preview.redd.it/lxp8ttxre8ag1.png?width=3920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f68e028710c494eb9a02b718696f29c8f44b4d2\n\nHey all,\n\nBy now many of you have experimented with the official **Qwen Image Edit 2511** workflow and have run into the same issue I have: the **reference image resizing** inside the *TextEncodeImageEditPlus* node. One common workaround has been to bypass that resizing by VAE\u2011encoding the reference images and chaining the conditioning like:\n\n**Text Encoder \u2192 Ref Latent 1 (original) \u2192 Ref Latent 2 (ref) \u2192 Ref Latent 3 (ref)**\n\nHowever, when trying to **transfer apparel/clothing** from a reference image onto a base image, both the official workflow and the VAE\u2011bypass version tend to **copy/paste the reference face** onto the original image instead of preserving the original facial features.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing a different conditioning flow that has been giving me **more consistent (though not perfect) results**:\n\n**Text Encoder \u2192 Ref Latent 1 \u2192 Ref Latent 1 conditions Ref Latent 2 + Ref Latent 3 \u2192 combine all conditionings**\n\nFrom what I can tell by looking at the node code, Ref Latent 1 ends up containing conditioning from the original image *and* both reference images. My working theory is that re\u2011applying this conditioning onto the two reference latents strengthens the original image\u2019s identity relative to the reference images.\n\nThe trade\u2011off is that **reference identity becomes slightly weaker**. For example, when transferring something like a pointed hat, the hat often \u201cflops\u201d instead of staying rigid\u2014almost like gravity is being re\u2011applied.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way to preserve the base image\u2019s identity *and* maintain strong reference conditioning, but I haven\u2019t cracked it yet. I\u2019ve also tried separately text\u2011encoding each image and combining them so Ref Latent 1 isn\u2019t overloaded, but that produced some very strange outputs.\n\nStill, I think this approach might be a step in the right direction, and maybe someone here can refine it further.\n\nIf you want to try the workflow, you can download it here:  \n[**Pastebin Link**](https://pastebin.com/6jpcm9gX)\n\nAlso, sampler/scheduler choice seems to matter a lot. I\u2019ve had great results with:\n\n* **er\\_sde** (sampler)\n* **bong\\_tangent** (scheduler)\n\n(Requires the [**RES4LYF**](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF) node to use these with KSampler.)\n\n**EDIT: For those that have had trouble with the custom nodes in the original WF, here is one that uses only native nodes:** [Pastebin Link](https://pastebin.com/Mj5MQDQk)",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThere\u2019s a massive trend right now towards \"Infinite Context\". The marketing pitch is: *\"Just dump your entire knowledge base into the prompt, the model will figure it out.\"*\n\n**I think this is a dangerous trap.**\n\nFrom my experiments, even SOTA models suffer from attention dilution when the \"Signal-to-Noise\" ratio drops. If you feed a model 100k tokens, but 30k of those are semantic duplicates, boilerplate, or low-entropy garbage, the reasoning quality degrades (and you pay a fortune).\n\n**The Hypothesis:** I believe we should focus less on \"how much can we fit\" and more on \"how dense is the information.\"\n\nTo test this, I built an open-source project called **EntropyGuard**. It\u2019s a local engine that attempts to quantify the \"Information Density\" of a dataset using **Shannon Entropy** and Semantic Similarity (Embeddings). It aggressively strips out data that doesn't add new *bits* of information to the context.\n\n**The Result:** Cleaning a dataset by entropy/semantic dedup often reduces size by 40-60% while *improving* retrieval accuracy in RAG systems. It seems \"dumber\" models with cleaner data often beat \"smarter\" models with noisy data.\n\n**I\u2019m looking for community perspective on the next step:** I want to evolve this tool to solve the biggest \"Data Hygiene\" bottlenecks. If you work with AI, what is the missing link in your data prep?\n\n1. **Semantic Chunking:** Should we split text based on meaning shifts rather than character counts?\n2. **Visual Audit:** Do we need better UIs to \"see\" the noise before we delete it?\n3. **Source Filtering:** Is the problem actually in the ingestion (PDF parsing) rather than the cleaning?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the **Data-Centric AI** approach vs. the **Model-Centric** approach. Are we lazy for relying on massive context windows?\n\n**Project link for those interested in the code:**[https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard](https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard)",

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

      "content": "**Infrastructure &amp; Environment:** I\u2019ve been training character LoRAs using **AI-Toolkit** on **RunPod H200** (\\~1.1 step/s). To streamline the process and minimize rental costs, I built a custom **Docker image** featuring the latest `aitoolkit` and updated **diffusers**. It\u2019s built on **PyTorch 2.9** and **CUDA 12.8** (the highest version currently supported by RunPod).\n\n* **Benefit:** This allows for \"one-click\" deployment via template, eliminating setup time and keeping total costs between $5-$10 USD.\n* **Note:** Currently, neither the official pod template nor RunComfy has updated Diffusers, but Qwen Image Edit 2511 requires the latest version of Diffusers. The author of AIToolkit has already updated it; those interested can see the explanation below: [\\[qwen-image\\] edit 2511 support by naykun \u00b7 Pull Request #12839 \u00b7 huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12839)  and [bump diffusers version \u00b7 ostris/ai-toolkit@356449e](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit/commit/356449ec3f7253e55d0d3a5a55b6dc0556a625e0)\n* **H100 or B200:** The reason I used B200 is that I didn't use quantized model. If you are renting an H100 graphics card, please enable fp8 quantization and text quantization. However, I don't recommend enabling them, otherwise you will encounter an OutOfMemoryError (OOM) (I've tried it, with batch=1 and resolution 1024). \n* **Gradient\\_checkpointing:** Also, set gradient\\_checkpointing = false. If you enable this, the speed will be very slow, which is not cost-effective for renting a graphics card.\n\n\uff08Someone asked for the template link, so I'm posting it here. When selecting a pod, **please filter for CUDA version 12.8 or higher.** [https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=zqe274rubr&amp;ref=0w3km5zx\uff09](https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=zqe274rubr&amp;ref=0w3km5zx\uff09)\n\n**Training Specs:**\n\n* **Dataset:** 70 high-quality images (Mixed full-body, half-body, and portraits).\n* **Resolution:** 1024 x 1024 (using a solid black 1024px image as control).\n* **Hyperparameters:**\n   * **Batch Size:** 1 / **Grad Accumulation:** 1 (Community consensus for better consistency).\n   * **Steps:** 5,000 - 10,000 (Snapshots every 500 steps).\n   * **Learning Rate:** Tested `1e-4` and `8e-5`.\n   * **Optimizer:** `AdamW` with `Cosine` scheduler.\n   * **Rank/Alpha:** 32/32 (also tested 64/32), non-quantized.\n\n**Captioning Strategy:** I developed a workflow using \"Prompts + Scripts + Gemini\" to generate rich natural language captions. My approach: **Describe every variable factor (clothing, background, lighting, pose) in detail, except for the character's fixed features.** I\u2019m more than happy to share the specific prompts and scripts I used for this if there's interest!\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is 5k-10k steps potentially \"over-baking\" for a 70-image dataset?\n2. Are there specific LR or Rank optimizations recommended for the Qwen Image Edit architecture?\n3. In your experience, does the \"describe everything but the subject\" rule still hold true for the latest Qwen models?",

      "title": "Complaints about ChatGPT",
      "content": "First, let me say I love ChatGPT.  I'm in the first 0.1% of users, apparently.  And messages.  I'm in the \"pro\" subscription.  I use it every day, many times a day.  It's replaced google for me.  So, this comes from a place of love.  And concern.\n\nIn no particular order...\n\n  \n1.  Advanced voice mode.  I believe this is still 4o.  At least, it says it is based on 4o if you ask it and I believe it.  Advanced voice mode was a big deal when it first came out.  I'd like it up to date with 5.2.  It feels way behind and much dumber.\n\n  \n2.  Code quality is not there.  I've been working on a side project.  Codex did okay, but after a while the project hit a certain complexity where codex would add a bug every time it made an update and couldn't resolve bugs.  I tested out Claude Code and it perfectly resolved the bugs and kept going.  Plus, at the 100 a month tier I get enough Claude Code for my work.\n\n  \n3.  Model quality doesn't stand out.  I got a free subscription to Gemini when I bought my phone.  Gemini Pro seems basically as good as 5.2 Thinking and it's faster.  In the API, for bulk stuff, I usually use gemini 2.5-flash-lite.  It's fast and cheap and good.  Just really hard to beat.\n\n  \n4.  Image generation.  Again Nano Banana is usually as good, and much faster.\n\n  \n5.  Moralizing.  I get not helping build bombs or make viruses or something, but beyond that, my feeling is that the model should do what you want.  I feel like they've taken \"safety\" way too far.  As an example, my four year old recently went berserk and started hitting his mother.  I put him in timeout and said he had to stay in timeout until he was ready to apologize for hitting.  Usually this is pretty brief, but this time, for whatever reason, my son just refused to say he was sorry.  I was checking on him frequently, he was doing his timeout in his old crib (which works to contain him), and he just refused to apologize.  I was talking to ChatGPT about it, wondering how long I should keep my son in timeout and if it would be bad for me to let him out without him apologizing, and ChatGPT told me it would not work with me to \"help design a system of indefinite detention.\"  \n\n  \n6.  \"You're not crazy.\"  ChatGPT tells me this all the time.  I know.  I've never expressed to ChatGPT doubts that I might be crazy.  I don't use it for \"therapy\" type stuff.  I can make the most banal observation and ChatGPT will tell me \"You're not crazy, that really happens.\"  And, yes, I know I'm not crazy, but it feels kind of like gaslighting to be constantly suggesting that I might be crazy.\n\n  \n7.  Apps and an app store.  What?  It's hard for me to imagine what a chat app would even be.  I've looked at their docs and demo, e.g. the end of year app, and... I guess I just don't feel any excitement about working on one or getting those.\n\n  \nUltimately, I feel sad that OpenAI, which was, previously, pretty clearly the best, is losing ground to competitors.   I also don't see how anything changes next year.\n\nThink about Grok.  In my opinion, Grok is almost a tier-1 model.  I think of tier-1 as being Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI, and kind of Grok.  Elon created Grok almost overnight.  Very little time.  And, it's pretty good.  Elon is building out huge datacenters.  He gives out huge amounts of free tokens on OpenRouter.  How is Grok not going to exceed OpenAI in 2026?\n\nWhat I mean is: if you think there is some special magic in OpenAI, then it seems like Grok shouldn't be able to (nearly) catch up in a year or so.  The fact that Grok can come out of nowhere makes me think there's not magic to building a big model and instead, it's about scale and engineering and budgets.  Maybe a little bit of magic explaining why Meta failed, but mostly scale.  \n\nAnd, if it is scale, then xAI and Google have more money and bigger datacenters.  Why won't they simple out scale OpenAI?\n\nLike I said at the start: I love ChatGPT.  Me and It go way back.  But, I'm worried about OpenAI in 2026.",

Neptune and OpenSearch were costing me roughly $500/mo just to keep the lights on with minimal traffic.\n\nI decided to migrate the entire GraphRAG stack to a single Dockerized EC2 instance using Neo4j and pgvector.\n\nThe technical trade-offs were surprising. By moving to a self-hosted stack on one node, I eliminated the network hops between serverless services, which dropped my retrieval latency from 200ms to under 60ms. My monthly bill went from $500 down to $180.\n\nIf you are building a B2B SaaS with predictable traffic, the \"scaling\" benefit of serverless Neptune often doesn't justify the 3x price premium and latency hit.

It aggressively filters data in two stages:\n\n1. **Exact Deduplication:** (xxHash) - Instantly kills 100% identical chunks.\n2. **Semantic Deduplication:** (Local Embeddings + FAISS) - Finds chunks that mean the same thing but are phrased slightly differently.\n\n**The ROI:** On a recent project with 200k documents, this tool cut the dataset size by \\~40%. That means **40% lower embedding costs** and **40% lower vector DB storage costs**. Plus, the retrieval quality actually went up because the context window isn't filled with noise.\n\nIt works 100% locally (no data sent to cloud for cleaning).\n\nIf you want to lower your API bill, give it a shot.\n\n**Install:** `pip install entropyguard`\n\n**entropyguard on github**  \n",

      "content": "*I built a Python library called* ***EmbeddingAdapters*** *that* ***provides multiple pre-trained adapters for translating embeddings from one model space into another***:\n\n[https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/](https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/)\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \n`pip install embedding-adapters`\n\n`embedding-adapters embed --source sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 --target openai/text-embedding-3-small --flavor large --text \"Where can I get a hamburger near me?\"`  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\n*This works because* ***each adapter is trained on a restrictive domain*** allowing the adapter to specialize in interpreting the semantic signals of smaller models into higher dimensional spaces without losing fidelity.\u00a0 ***A quality endpoint then lets you determine how well the adapter will perform*** *on a given input.*\n\nThis has been super useful to me, and I'm quickly iterating on it.\n\nUses for ***EmbeddingAdapters*** so far:\n\n1. You want to **use an existing vector index built with one embedding model and query it with another** \\- if it's expensive or problematic to re-embed your entire corpus, this is the package for you.\n2. You can also **operate mixed vector indexes** and map to the embedding space that works best for different questions.\n3. You can **save cost on questions that are easily adapted**, \"What's the nearest restaurant that has a Hamburger?\" no need to pay for an expensive cloud provider, or wait to perform an unnecessary network hop, embed locally on the device with an embedding adapter and return results instantly.\n\nIt also lets you experiment with provider embeddings you may not have access to.\u00a0 By using the adapters on some queries and examples, you can compare how different embedding models behave relative to one another and get an early signal on what might work for your data before committing to a provider.\n\nThis makes it practical to:  \n\\- **sample providers you don't have direct access to**  \n\\- **migrate or experiment with embedding models gradually** instead of re-embedding everything at once,  \n\\- ***evaluate multiple providers side by side*** in a consistent retrieval setup,  \n\\- ***handle provider outages or rate limits*** without breaking retrieval,  \n\\- ***run RAG in air-gapped or restricted environments*** with no outbound embedding calls,  \n\\- ***keep a stable \u201ccanonical\u201d embedding space*** while changing what runs at the edge.\n\nThe adapters aren't perfect clones of the provider spaces but they are pretty close, for in domain queries the minilm to openai adapter recovered 98% of the openai embedding and dramatically outperforms minilm -&gt; minilm RAG setups\n\nIt's still early\u00a0in this project. I\u2019m actively expanding the set of supported adapter pairs, adding domain-specialized adapters, expanding the training sets, stream lining the\u00a0models and improving evaluation and quality tooling.\n\nI\u2019d love feedback from anyone who might be interested in using this:  \n*- What data would you like to see these adapters trained on?*  \n*- What domains would be most helpful to target?*  \n*- Which model pairs would you like me\u00a0to add next?*  \n*- How could\u00a0I make this more useful for you to use?*\n\nSo far the\u00a0library supports:  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; openai*\u00a0  \n*openai &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; minilm*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; openai*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; gemini*\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone has any ideas please let me know.  \nI could use any support you can give, especially if anyone wants to chip in to help cover the training cost.\n\nPlease upvote if you can, thanks!",

      "content": "The current media hand-wringing over AI is an exercise in wilful myopia, a panicked rehashing of hypotheticals already debunked by history and elementary game theory. To listen to pundits, the future is binary: either technological utopia or a Skynet-meets-oligarchy dystopia where a handful of men hoard all the automated robots, farmland and powerful AI. This lazy framing fundamentally misunderstands the forces at play.\n\nLet's dispense with the melodrama: the \"AI takes all the jobs\" panic conveniently forgets the agricultural revolution, where 70% of the populace traded the plow for the factory and, crucially, didn't starve to death. Technology doesn't eliminate *need*; it shifts the *means* of satisfying it. If robots produce everything, the economic problem becomes distribution, not scarcity\u2014a vastly superior problem to have.\n\nThe real intellectual failure, however, lies in the \"oligarchs control all the robots\" scenario. This assumes a state of perfect, perpetual, passive control over the most powerful, easily replicable technology ever conceived. It\u2019s a fantasy of unilateral dominance that ignores the **billion-fold intelligence operating on Earth. You know,** **US**. The non-oligarchs. We are legion, and they are few.\n\nIf certain politician's doom-theory scenarios were to come to fruition\u2014\"oligarchs control all the robots\"\u2014then, quite simply, the billions of non-oligarchs of the world would use their open-source robots and AI to crush the oligarchs. The numbers are always on our side. And infinitely-replicating intelligent technology like AI **shifts the power balance from financial resources to cognitive resources**, and no oligarch can hope to beat 7 billion AI-enhanced human minds. Not possible. Not going to happen. In this AI-enhanced scenario, more-brains beats more-dollars every time.\n\nThis is where game theory trumps fear-mongering.\n\nOpen-source AI is the immune system of the technological future. We have seen that it is always nipping at the heels of closed-source AI. And that will always be the case. The incentives are too powerful to ignore. It ensures that any closed-source lead, any attempt at a monopoly on intelligence and production, is not a permanent fixture but a temporary speed bump. The barrier to entry for replicating a world-changing tool is already plummeting.\n\nThe greatest threat isn't the AI itself, but the media's obsession with a simple, sensationalised dystopia. The truth is more complex, less dramatic, and far more empowering: the ingenuity of billions, coupled with the replicability of open-source technology, is the ultimate anti-oligarch force.\n\nThe future will be decentralised. The future will be ours.\n\n[3D printing spaghetti and cheese houses.

The shown grid is not background luminance corrected.\n3. **Yaw, Pitch, Roll Distribution**: Z-Image-Turbo has exceptionally high shot-type adherence. It also has some biases here, Yaw variations is definitely higher in female presenting subjects than in male presenting. The Roll-distribution is interesting, this may not be entirely ZIT fault, and some is an effect of asymmetric faces that are actually upright but have slightly varied eye/iris level heights. I will not have to exclude many images - everything |Yaw| &lt; 15\u00b0 can be considered facing the camera, which is approximately 99% of the data.\n4. **Extraction Algorithm Test**: This shows 225 faces extracted using Greedy Furthest Point Sampling from a random sub-sample of size 2048.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n* Throwing out (flagging) all the images that have some sort of defect (Yaw, Face intersects frame etc.)\n*  Analyzing the images more thoroughly and likely a second targeted run of a few 100k images trying to fill gaps.\n\nThe final dataset (of yet unknown size) will be made available on HF.",

You point it at a sitemap, it crawls + chunks + embeds everything, and exposes it via MCP so Claude/Cursor/whatever can query it.\n\n**Technical bits if anyone cares:**\n\n* Embeddings via OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims)\n* Chunking with \\~1000 token targets and overlap\n* Postgres with pgvector for storage\n* Standard MCP JSON-RPC implementation\n\n**Why I built it:** Got tired of the RAG setup dance every time I wanted to search some docs. Wanted something where I just paste a URL and it works. No vector db config, no chunking strategy tweaking, just \"here's my docs, make them searchable.\"\n\n**What I'm curious about:**\n\n* For those who've done RAG setups - is the hosted/managed approach appealing or do you prefer controlling everything yourself?\n* Anyone actually using MCP regularly? Trying to gauge if the ecosystem is there yet\n* What features would make something like this actually useful vs. just another tool?\n\nI'm looking for early testers who want to poke around and give honest feedback.

      "content": "I've been using ChatGPT pretty heavily for writing and coding for the past year, and I kept running into the same frustrating pattern. The outputs were... fine. Usable. But they always needed a ton of editing, or they'd miss the point, or they'd do exactly what I told it not to do.\n\nSpent way too long thinking \"maybe ChatGPT just isn't that good for this\" before realizing the problem was how I was prompting it.\n\nHere's what actually made a difference:\n\n**Give ChatGPT fewer decisions to make**\n\nThis took me way too long to figure out. I'd ask ChatGPT to \"write a good email\" or \"help me brainstorm ideas\" and get back like 8 different options or these long exploratory responses.\n\nSounds helpful, right? Except then I'd spend 10 minutes deciding between the options, or trying to figure out which parts to actually use.\n\nThe breakthrough was realizing that every choice ChatGPT gives you is a decision you have to make later. And decisions are exhausting.\n\nWhat actually works: Force ChatGPT to make the decisions for you.\n\nInstead of \"give me some subject line options,\" try \"give me the single best subject line for this email, optimized for open rate, under 50 characters.\"\n\nInstead of \"help me brainstorm,\" try \"give me the 3 most practical ideas, ranked by ease of implementation, with one sentence explaining why each would work.\"\n\nYou can always ask for alternatives if you don't like the first output. But starting with \"give me one good option\" instead of \"give me options\" saves so much mental energy.\n\n**Be specific about format before you even start**\n\nMost people (including me) would write these long rambling prompts explaining what we want, then get frustrated when ChatGPT's response was also long and rambling.\n\nIf you want a structured output, you need to define that structure upfront. Not as a vague \"make it organized\" but as actual formatting requirements.\n\nFor writing: \"Give me 3 headline options, then 3 paragraphs max, each paragraph under 50 words.\"\n\nFor coding: \"Show the function first, then explain what it does in 2-3 bullet points, then show one usage example.\"\n\nThis forces ChatGPT to organize its thinking before generating, which somehow makes the actual content better too.\n\n**Context isn't just background info**\n\nI used to think context meant explaining the situation. Like \"I'm writing a blog post about productivity.\"\n\nThat's not really context. That's just a topic.\n\nReal context is:\n\n* Who's reading this and what do they already know\n* What problem they're trying to solve right now\n* What they've probably already tried\n* What specific outcome you need\n\nExample: Bad: \"Write a blog post about time management\"\n\nBetter: \"Write for freelancers who already know the basics of time blocking but struggle with inconsistent client schedules. They've tried rigid planning and it keeps breaking. Focus on flexible structure, not discipline.\"\n\nThe second one gives ChatGPT enough constraints to actually say something useful instead of regurgitating generic advice.\n\n**Constraints are more important than creativity**\n\nThis is counterintuitive but adding more constraints makes the output better, not worse.\n\nWhen you give ChatGPT total freedom, it defaults to the most common patterns it's seen. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nBut if you add tight constraints, it has to actually think:\n\n* \"Max 150 words\"\n* \"Use only simple words, nothing above 8th grade reading level\"\n* \"Every paragraph must start with a question\"\n* \"Include at least one specific number or example per section\"\n\nThese aren't restrictions. They're forcing functions that make ChatGPT generate something less generic.\n\n**Tasks need to be stupid-clear**\n\n\"Help me write better\" is not a task. \"Make this good\" is not a task.\n\nA task is: \"Rewrite this paragraph to be 50% shorter while keeping the main point.\"\n\nOr: \"Generate 5 subject line options for this email. Each under 50 characters. Ranked by likely open rate.\"\n\nOr: \"Review this code and identify exactly where the memory leak is happening. Explain in plain English, then show the fixed version.\"\n\nThe more specific the task, the less you have to edit afterward.\n\n**One trick that consistently works**\n\nIf you're getting bad outputs, try this structure:\n\n1. Define the role: \"You are an expert \\[specific thing\\]\"\n2. Give context: \"The audience is \\[specific people\\] who \\[specific situation\\]\"\n3. State the task: \"Create \\[exact deliverable\\]\"\n4. Add constraints: \"Requirements: \\[specific limits and rules\\]\"\n5. Specify format: \"Structure: \\[exactly how to organize it\\]\"\n\nI know it seems like overkill, but this structure forces you to think through what you actually need before you ask for it. And it gives ChatGPT enough guardrails to stay on track.\n\n**The thing nobody talks about**\n\nBetter prompts don't just save editing time. They change what's possible.\n\nI used to think \"ChatGPT can't do X\" about a bunch of tasks. Turns out it could, I just wasn't prompting it correctly. Once I started being more structured and specific, the quality ceiling went way up.\n\nIt's not about finding magic words. It's about being clear enough that the AI knows exactly what you want and what you don't want.\n\nAnyway, if you want some actual prompt examples that use this structure, I put together 5 professional ones you can copy-paste, let me know if you want them.\n\nThe difference between a weak prompt and a strong one is pretty obvious once you see them side by side.",

      "content": "Has anyone else noticed that new releases from Zhipu AI's GLM series tend to be a bit sluggish and underperform at launch? I've experienced this consistently with each update.For instance, today I got into a bit of a \"debate\" with GLM-4.7 over the current date. \n\nIt stubbornly insisted we were still in May 2024, while I pointed out it's December 29, 2025. It even accused me of time-traveling from the future, claiming that's impossible! \n\nI prompted it to verify by searching online or using available tools, but in its reasoning trace, it was clear it was simulating a response without actually doing the work it just echoed back a fabricated date to avoid admitting error. \n\nFrustrated, I switched to the previous version, GLM-4.6V, and it immediately confirmed the correct date without issue.This isn't isolated; when GLM-4.6 first dropped, I ran into the exact same problems. \n\nIt seems like a recurring pattern: fresh models come out \"lazy,\" failing to properly leverage online searches, tool calls, or real-time data integration. From a technical standpoint, this could stem from initial fine-tuning hiccups where the model's tool-calling mechanisms aren't fully optimized, or perhaps there's a regression in how it handles dynamic knowledge retrieval beyond its training cutoff. \n\nIt might also relate to how these models are quantized or adapted for local inference, potentially throttling their ability to invoke external APIs or browsers effectively right out of the gate.If it were just one model, I'd chalk it up to a fluke, but this trend has me sticking with the prior version for most tasks until the new one gets patched or stabilized. \n\nHave you encountered similar issues with GLM-4.7, or what's your experience been like? I'm curious if it's a widespread thing or just my setup maybe we can share tips on workarounds.\n\nOn a brighter note, it's exciting to see how quickly the community iterates on these models; with collective feedback, they'll only get sharper over time!",

      "content": "  \nI would like to know your thoughts on this:  \n\\----  \nI recently watched a video by the YouTuber Jared Henderson: [An AI Company Wants to Clone Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2vPs8ld4nU)  \nHere's the gist of the video.  \n\\- He was approached by an AI cloning startup that wants to create an AI clone of him, so that his clone can interact with his fans/clients (paid sessions) on behalf of him. He refused that, saying that's not authentic.\n\n\\- The 2nd example he gave was of a woman talking to an AI clone of her dead mother.\n\n\\- He then proceeded to make the argument that companies that create AI clones are profiting off loneliness, grief and the need for human connection. He says AI clones creates a \"para-social\" connection i.e. a connection that mimics real life, but it actually isn't real life.  \n\\----  \nNow coming to my thoughts on this.   \nI do not disagree with Jared Henderson completely, but I think his arguments was very one sided.\n\n\\- From the angle of profiting off loneliness and connection, if human clones can be criticized, then so can any dating app be criticized by the same logic. And I have actually found people who have pointed this out\n\n\\- Going a step further, the relationship between any \"celebrity\" (here i also include social media personalities) and a fan/viewer/subscriber can also be termed as para-social, because it's not a one-on-one realtionship. So, even when Jared Henderson connects with his audience through his videos or articles, that connection is still para-social, and any  money he, or any celebrity makes off it, can be termed as monetzing off para-social relations. So to only blame AI clones, is not fair.\n\n  \n\\- Finally, coming to AI clones of dead people, he argues that the AI clones are not the real person, and such services are only monetizing other people's grief.  \n  \nBut, people keep pictures and videos of loved ones that are no longer alive, as a way to remember them. We know that photos and videos are not the real person, it's just pixels and bits in a computer. But it still helps people have a memory of someone who's gone.  \n\n\nAI clones only add another layer of personality to a dead person. We know it's not the real person. But it adds an aditional layer of interactivity, beyond pictures and videos. So why bash one technology (AI clones), if other technology (pictures and Videos) are acceptable?",

This happens even with short prompts and low temperature settings.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve tried a few workarounds:\n\n\n\nRunning the model via llama.cpp on Apple Silicon \u2013 identical behavior.\n\nUsing mlx\\_lm (the MLX\u2011based inference library) \u2013 again, EOS pops up unexpectedly.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to be a memory issue or a problem with my prompt length. The truncation happens at the same token position each time for a given prompt. \n\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\n\n\nDid you find any fixes or workarounds (e.g., adjusting max\\_tokens, disabling certain optimizations, patching the model weights, updating libraries)?\n\nAny insights, suggestions, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "I put together an AI Trends 2025 recap from the angle of \u201cwhat changed in day-to-day usage,\u201d not headlines. I use ChatGPT a lot for real work, and the biggest shift this year (for me) was less about single prompts and more about repeatable workflows.\n\nHere are the parts that actually felt different in 2025:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Multi-step flows became the default. I stopped treating prompts like one-and-done. It\u2019s more like: plan \u2192 draft \u2192 critique \u2192 revise \u2192 verify \u2192 format.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Structured outputs got more reliable. Turning a mess into something usable\u2014tables, checklists, rubrics, meeting recaps, decision notes\u2014saved more time than \u201ccreative\u201d outputs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Context handling mattered more than raw cleverness. The models that felt best were the ones that stayed consistent across a long thread and didn\u2019t drift when you tightened constraints.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tool-based work got more normal. When the model can work with steps (and you can review each step), it\u2019s easier to trust for work tasks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification became part of the workflow. I now bake in \u201cshow sources,\u201d \u201cstate assumptions,\u201d or \u201cgive me a quick cross-check plan\u201d anytime the stakes go up.\n\nI also covered the model releases that kept coming up in real conversations: GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, and Llama 4\u2014mainly because they pushed expectations around reliability, long tasks, and quality.\n\nFor more details, check out the full article here: https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-toolkit/ai-trends-2025/\n\nQuestion for the power users here: what\u2019s your most repeatable \u201cdaily driver\u201d workflow right now\u2014the one you could hand to someone else as a template and it would still work?",

It\u2019s a local-first CLI using **Polars LazyFrames** and **FAISS** to clean up your dataset from duplicates in 2 stages: firstly by xxHash (faster) and then semantically (more complex).\n\nIt got some solid feedback so far, but it still feels like it should offer more to be a \"no-brainer\" install.\n\nThe main engine is built, but now I am stuck.\n\nI do not want to build features that won't be used by anyone. I want to build something that solves your actual problem and saves you time.\n\n**I'm considering a few features now:**\n\n* **Semantic chunking:** Currently I rely on standard recursive splitters. Should I bake in cosine-based splitting?\n* **TUI for sanity checks:** Some sort of terminal UI to visually audit what's going to be deleted before pulling the trigger.\n* **PII scrubbing:** Automatically detecting and redacting emails, API keys, etc. using Presidio or regex.\n* **PDF hell solver:** Built-in wrappers for `docling` or `unstructured` to handle layout-heavy PDFs, so you could pipe a raw folder directly into clean JSONL.\n\n**Or should it be something completely different?**\n\nIs there any specific part of your RAG pipeline that is currently manual or just painful? I want this tool to be robust enough for production use cases.\n\nLet me know what specifically would make you `pip install entropyguard`?\n\n**Repo for context:** [https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard](https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard)",

But tools like Word or even Scrivener, while powerful, still feel\u2026\u00a0*passive*. They hold your notes, but don\u2019t\u00a0*participate*.\n\nSo I built something different:\u00a0[**AIStory**](https://aistory.base44.app/).\n\nIt\u2019s not another \u201cAI writer\u201d that spits out generic prose. Instead, it\u2019s an\u00a0**AI co-author**\u00a0designed to work\u00a0*with*\u00a0your messy process:\n\n* **Start anywhere**: Jot down a phrase, a scene, a character trait \u2014 just like on an index card. AIStory doesn\u2019t demand you begin with Chapter 1.\n* **Let it connect the dots**: The AI analyzes your fragments and gently suggests links: \u201cThis metaphor about \u2018broken clocks\u2019 might tie into your protagonist\u2019s backstory. Want to explore that?\u201d\n* **Grow your structure**: As you add more, it helps you build a dynamic beat sheet and character web \u2014 not as a template to fill, but as a living map of your story\u2019s heartbeat.\n* **Protect your voice**: You can guide the AI with \u201cstyle anchors\u201d (e.g., \u201ckeep it in the tone of Le Guin\u201d or \u201cchannel Murakami\u2019s surrealism\u201d), so it enhances, not replaces, your voice.\n\n\n\nI know this community is (rightfully) skeptical of AI tools that promise \u201ceasy books.\u201d\u00a0**AIStory isn\u2019t about making writing easy \u2014 it\u2019s about making the chaos of creation feel less lonely.**\n\n\n\nI\u2019d be honored if any of you wanted to try it. There\u2019s a free tier, and I\u2019m actively incorporating feedback from professional writers like yourselves.\n\n\n\n**Link**:\u00a0[https://aistory.base44.app/](https://aistory.base44.app/)  \n**My ask**: If you give it a shot, I\u2019d genuinely appreciate your blunt, writer-to-writer feedback \u2014 good or bad.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and happy writing!  \n\u2014 A fellow novelist &amp; builder",

After training on most of the data, the model is evaluated with unseen test data to ensure it can generalize what it has learned rather than just memorizing the training set. \n\nAs training continues, the iterative process of prediction, error measurement, and parameter adjustment pushes the model toward minimal error, enabling accurate predictions on new inputs. \n\n\\- Once the loss has been reduced significantly and the model performs well on test cases, it can reliably make correct predictions, demonstrating that it has captured the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n  \nRead in detail here: [https://www.decodeai.in/how-do-ai-models-learn/](https://www.decodeai.in/how-do-ai-models-learn/)",

I haven't found a good loop workflow that consistently gives me usable video. I paid for Midjourney but that seems like it was a mistake. I can make better stills in Comfy UI and their image to video generation largely produces unusable camera jitter when trying to make loops. Grok also can't seems to make a viable looping image. I'm not wanting to pay for another tool that's going to be just as bad.\n\nAlways willing to concede it's a PEBKAC issue. Been tinkering for \\~2 weeks or so. So much I don't know yet. Also willing to learn the tool but really hunting for something usable out of the box to learn on.\n\nHas anyone used Dream Machine?

Cognitive Prosthetics &amp; Extended Mind\n\n\t\u2022\tIdentify how high-cognition users (engineers, analysts, designers, neurodivergent users, writers, complex project leads) employ AI as extended cognition rather than conversation.\n\n\t\u2022\tDescribe the functional requirements for such systems:\n\n\t\u2022\tidentity stability\n\n\t\u2022\treasoning-pattern persistence\n\n\t\u2022\tsemantic anchors\n\n\t\u2022\tlong-horizon continuity\n\n\t\u2022\tpredictable interpretive frames\n\n\t\u2022\tmemory-like scaffolding\n\n\t\u2022\tExplain how unpredictable model drift breaks joint cognition and why reliability becomes a safety feature rather than a luxury.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2.

Errors everywhere, can't see my drafts, only see a couple videos on home, can't make new videos.\n\nThe only way to fix it is to turn on my VPN. Then I can use it fine, both PC and mobile. But then a bit later it always starts doing it again.\n\nOnly way to fix it is to turn my VPN off. Works for a bit then happens again.\n\nEvery day I have to go through this cycle of turning my vpn off and on and off and on over and over and over again.\n\nIt's not my internet. I am 110% sure. I went to a hotel and it was happening there, and it was also happening at a family member's house who has faster internet than I do.  \nNo other sites or apps have issues, ONLY Sora. I can watch a YouTube video fine with no buffering.\n\nWhat is going on?",

      "content": "All things considered, Mars and the Moon are pretty nearby. But they have one big problem... no air. No meaningful atmosphere. They have a little sometimes but not enough. Atmosphere would help keep heat in and support life so people could exist outside of bubbles. \n\nVenus is even closer than Mars but its too hot, primarily because it has WAY TOO MUCH atmosphere. \n\nWell thats convinient. If we just \"scoop up\" a lot of Venus's atmosphere and ship it to Mars and the Moon, over a long period of time, we could possibly make all three habitable. \n\nSo what are some ways we can move an atmosphere? \n\nI think about this a lot and heres the best way I could come up with. refrigeration units mounted on blimps that would float high in the Venetian atmosphere, freezing out the atmosphere itself into giant chunks of super cooled ice. Then a magnetic rail gun-style catapult that would shoot the giant ice chunk in to a low orbit, in the path of another satellite that would grab and and use the same method shoot the ice chunk out of Venuss orbit and on a collision course with the Moon and Mars. We would need tons of these things, all firing non stop ice bullets. The whole thing would be solar powered and unmanned. It would take a very long time but our descendants would really appreciate our forward thinking. \n\nI don't know if thats the best way to move atmosphere from Venus to Mars but its the only way I can think of. Other than rockets flying back and forth. But that would require so much energy compared to just shooting blocks of ice through bare space. ",
