      "content": "Temporal abstraction is a key missing ingredient for long-term RL (to avoid the curse of the one-step model, as @RichardSSutton likes to say). Language is one approach to such abstraction, but animals show it can be learned from data without human labels. But how? It is hard to learn learn temporally abstract options using standard hierarchical RL methods. This paper, from the Google team led by @neurosacramento,  takes an approach inspired by LLM pre and post training. Let me explain.\n\nFirst it pre-trains a sequence model on unlabeled expert trajectories, generated by goal-seeking agents. The model learns to predict the next action (and optionally next observation) given previous observations, without knowing the goal or the sequence boundaries. The model is a standard transformer, with L blocks, shown in Fig 1. Here e(t,l) is the residual stream at time t and layer l. These learn the relevant temporal abstractions.\n\nNext it modifies the model by inserting a control signal, U(t), at layer l, to get e'(t,l)=e(t,l) + U(t) e(t,l). This generates the desired action a'(t), as shown in Fig 2. The control signal is generated from a latent variable, u(t) = f(z(t)). This model  is trained (using amoritzed variational inference) to maximize the likelihood of another set of expert trajectories, using a non-causal encoder, z(t)=enc(o(1:T)). \n\nFinally, it replaces the offline variational controller with a causal controller, that is trained using online RL (with the rest of the model being frozen). At each step, the SSM-based controller generates a stochastic latent z'(t). In addition, a GRU-based switching module generates a switch probability, beta(t).  Finally the latent control z(t) is either set to the new latent action z'(t), or it remains equal to the previous latent action, z(t-1), as determined by a (thresholded) beta(t). See fig 3. This generates long chunks of constant action signals, corresponding to temporally abstract options.\n\nThe result is a method that can learn to control a low-level mujoco ant (given full observability) to solve long horizon tasks, visiting combinatorially new sequences of goal locations.\n\nThe authors also claim this model is similar to the how the brain solves such problems - the  transformer model is like the cortex (designed to predict what will happen next in the environment given that the agent is following some goal), and the controller is like the basal ganglia / striatum, designed to choose the next latent internal goal to aim for.",

Here is Grok’s interesting response:\n\n**The country with the largest north-south extent** is a surprisingly debated topic, but based on reliable measurements of **contiguous (continuous) mainland territory**, **Brazil** edges out **Chile** by a small margin.\n\n### Key Comparisons\n- **Brazil**:  \n  - North-south distance ≈ **4,378–4,395 km**  \n  - Latitude span ≈ **39 degrees** (roughly from 5.27°N to 33.75°S)  \n  - This makes it the longest continuous north-south span among sovereign countries.\n\n- **Chile**:  \n  - North-south distance ≈ **4,270–4,300 km** (sometimes cited as 4,620 km in older/rounded sources)  \n  - Latitude span ≈ **38–39 degrees** (roughly from 17.5°S to 56°S, or 55.98°S when precise)  \n  - Famous for its narrow, elongated shape — often popularly called the \"longest\" country.\n\nThe CIA World Factbook and many general sources still describe **Chile** as the longest north-south trending country, likely due to historical rounding of latitude extremes (e.g., rounding to 17°S–56°S). However, more precise geographic calculations (from sources like Reddit geography discussions citing exact coordinates, Quora analyses, and direct distance measurements) consistently show **Brazil** slightly ahead for contiguous land.\n\n### Other Notable Contenders\n- **Russia** → North-south extent is only ~2,500–4,000 km (latitude ~41°N to 82°N), but it is overwhelmingly east-west oriented.\n- Countries with discontinuous territories (e.g., France or Norway including overseas departments/territories) can claim much larger spans but are usually excluded from \"contiguous\" rankings.\n\n**Bottom line**: If we're talking about the greatest uninterrupted north-south distance across continuous territory, **Brazil** holds the title — though **Chile** remains the most iconic and widely recognized \"tall\" country due to its dramatic shape and near-universal mention in textbooks and media.",
