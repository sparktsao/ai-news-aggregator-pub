      "content": "\nZ.ai, formerly known as Ziphu AI, the developer of the GLM family of large language models (LLMs), made its public market debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, becoming, as investors describe, the world\u2019s first publicly listed large language model company.\n\n\n\nThe company, which trades under the ticker 02513.HK, priced its shares at HK$116.20 apiece and opened at HK$120.00, giving it a market capitalisation of approximately HK$52.83 billion, or $6.8 billion. With the listing, the company raised roughly $558 million, according to a press release from Qiming Venture Partners, one of the company\u2019s early backers.\n\n\n\nFounded in 2019, Z.ai develops open-weight LLMs (allowing users to customise models for specific tasks) that, across multiple benchmarks, have matched or exceeded the performance of both open-source and proprietary models from the United States, while competing closely with Chinese peers such as DeepSeek and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQiming Venture Partners claimed, \u201cZ.ai has grown into China\u2019s largest independent large language model developer.\u201d The firm added that, as of September 30, 2025, Z.ai\u2019s models were deployed across more than 12,000 enterprise customers, over 80 million end-user devices, and supported more than 45 million developers globally\u2014making it the independent general-purpose large-model provider in China with the highest number of enabled end-user devices.\n\n\n\nZhang Peng, CEO of Z.ai, said in a statement, \u201cGoing public means we must shoulder even greater social responsibility and industry mission.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe added that the company will continue to focus on \u201cfully independent, controllable full-stack large-model technology,\u201d while pushing forward improvements in reasoning, coding, and multimodal capabilities across the GLM model series.\n\n\n\nZ.ai is listed under Hong Kong\u2019s Chapter 18C (Specialist Technology Companies) regime, implying higher volatility and valuation uncertainty compared with profitable semiconductor issuers, as revealed in the IPO prospectus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile revenue grew rapidly to RMB 312.4 million (\u2248 HK$345 million, or $42 million) in 2024 (130%+ CAGR since 2022), the company reported net losses of RMB 2.96 billion (\u2248 HK$3.28 billion, or $420 million) in 2024, largely driven by heavy R&amp;D spending.\n\n\n\nAround 70% of IPO proceeds are earmarked for continued large-model R&amp;D rather than capacity expansion or near-term commercialisation, unlike hardware peers raising capital for fabs, chips, or servers.&nbsp;\nThe post World\u2019s First LLM Company Goes Public\u00a0 appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "Meta and Harvard Researchers Introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA): A Software Engineering Agent that can Operate at Large-Scale Codebases",
      "content": "How far can a mid sized language model go if the real innovation moves from the backbone into the agent scaffold and tool stack? Meta and Harvard researchers have released the Confucius Code Agent, an open sourced AI software engineer built on the Confucius SDK that is designed for industrial scale software repositories and long running sessions. The system targets real GitHub projects, complex test toolchains at evaluation time, and reproducible results on benchmarks such as SWE Bench Pro and SWE Bench Verified, while exposing the full scaffold for developers.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10398\n\n\nConfucius SDK, scaffolding around the model\n\n\n\nThe Confucius SDK is an agent development platform that treats scaffolding as a primary design problem rather than a thin wrapper around a language model. It is organized around 3 axes, Agent Experience, User Experience, and Developer Experience.\n\n\n\nAgent Experience controls what the model sees, including context layout, working memory and tool results. User Experience focuses on readable traces, code diffs and safeguards for human engineers. Developer Experience focuses on observability, configuration and debugging of the agent itself.\n\n\n\nThe SDK introduces 3 core mechanisms, a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory, a persistent note taking system, and a modular extension interface for tools. A meta agent then automates synthesis and refinement of agent configurations through a build, test, improve loop. The Confucius Code Agent is one concrete instantiation of this scaffold for software engineering.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10398\n\n\nHierarchical working memory for long horizon coding\n\n\n\nReal software tasks on SWE Bench Pro often require reasoning over dozens of files and many interaction steps. The orchestrator in Confucius SDK maintains hierarchical working memory, which partitions a trajectory into scopes, summarizes past steps and keeps compressed context for later turns.\n\n\n\nThis design helps keep prompts within model context limits while preserving important artifacts such as patches, error logs and design decisions. The key point is that effective tool based coding agents need an explicit memory architecture, not just a sliding window of previous messages.\n\n\n\nPersistent note taking for cross session learning\n\n\n\nThe second mechanism is a note taking system that uses a dedicated agent to write structured Markdown notes from execution traces. These notes capture task specific strategies, repository conventions and common failure modes, and they are stored as long term memory that can be reused across sessions.\n\n\n\nThe research team ran Confucius Code Agent twice on 151 SWE Bench Pro instances with Claude 4.5 Sonnet. On the first run the agent solves tasks from scratch and generates notes. On the second run the agent reads these notes. In this setting, average turns drop from 64 to 61, token usage drops from about 104k to 93k, and Resolve@1 improves from 53.0 to 54.4. This shows that notes are not just logs, they function as effective cross session memory.\n\n\n\nModular extensions and tool use sophistication\n\n\n\nConfucius SDK exposes tools as extensions, for example file editing, command execution, test runners and code search. Each extension can maintain its own state and prompt wiring. \n\n\n\nThe research team studies the impact of tool use sophistication using an ablation on a 100 example subset of SWE Bench Pro. With Claude 4 Sonnet, moving from a configuration without advanced context features to one with advanced context raises Resolve@1 from 42.0 to 48.6. With Claude 4.5 Sonnet, a simple tool use configuration reaches 44.0, while richer tool handling reaches 51.6, with 51.0 for an intermediate variant. These numbers indicate that how the agent chooses and sequences tools matters almost as much as the backbone model choice.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10398\n\n\nMeta agent for automatic agent design\n\n\n\nOn top of these mechanisms, the Confucius SDK includes a meta agent that takes a natural language specification of an agent and iteratively proposes configurations, prompts and extension sets. It then runs the candidate agent on tasks, inspects traces and metrics, and edits the configuration in a build, test, improve loop.\n\n\n\nThe Confucius Code Agent that the research team evaluates is produced with the help of this meta agent, rather than only hand tuned. This approach turns some of the agent engineering process itself into an LLM guided optimization problem.\n\n\n\nResults on SWE Bench Pro and SWE Bench Verified\n\n\n\nThe main evaluation uses SWE Bench Pro, which has 731 GitHub issues that require modifying real repositories until tests pass. All compared systems share the same repositories, tool environment and evaluation harness, so differences come from the scaffolds and models. \n\n\n\nOn SWE Bench Pro, the reported Resolve@1 scores are\n\n\n\n\nClaude 4 Sonnet with SWE Agent, 42.7\n\n\n\nClaude 4 Sonnet with Confucius Code Agent, 45.5\n\n\n\nClaude 4.5 Sonnet with SWE Agent, 43.6\n\n\n\nClaude 4.5 Sonnet with Live SWE Agent, 45.8\n\n\n\nClaude 4.5 Sonnet with Confucius Code Agent, 52.7\n\n\n\nClaude 4.5 Opus with Anthropic system card scaffold, 52.0\n\n\n\nClaude 4.5 Opus with Confucius Code Agent, 54.3 \n\n\n\n\nThese results show that a strong scaffold with a mid tier model, Claude 4.5 Sonnet with Confucius Code Agent at 52.7, can outperform a stronger model with a weaker scaffold, Claude 4.5 Opus with 52.0.\n\n\n\nOn SWE Bench Verified, Confucius Code Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet reaches Resolve@1 74.6, compared to 66.6 for SWE Agent and 72.8 for OpenHands. A mini SWE Agent variant with Claude 4.5 Sonnet reaches 70.6, which is also below Confucius Code Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet.\n\n\n\nThe research team also report performance as a function of edited file count. For tasks editing 1 to 2 files, Confucius Code Agent reaches 57.8 Resolve@1, for 3 to 4 files it reaches 49.2, for 5 to 6 files it reaches 44.1, for 7 to 10 files it reaches 52.6, and for more than 10 files it reaches 44.4. This indicates stable behavior on multi file changes in large codebases.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nScaffolding can outweigh model size: Confucius Code Agent shows that with strong scaffolding, Claude 4.5 Sonnet reaches 52.7 Resolve@1 on SWE-Bench-Pro, surpassing Claude 4.5 Opus with a weaker scaffold at 52.0.\n\n\n\nHierarchical working memory is essential for long horizon coding: The Confucius SDK orchestrator uses hierarchical working memory and context compression to manage long trajectories over large repositories, rather than relying on a simple rolling history.\n\n\n\nPersistent notes act as effective cross session memory: On 151 SWE-Bench-Pro tasks with Claude 4.5 Sonnet, reusing structured notes reduces turns from 64 to 61, token usage from about 104k to 93k, and increases Resolve@1 from 53.0 to 54.4.\n\n\n\nTool configuration materially impacts success rates: On a 100 task SWE-Bench-Pro subset, moving from simple to richer tool handling with Claude 4.5 Sonnet increases Resolve@1 from 44.0 to 51.6, indicating that learned tool routing and recovery strategies are a major performance lever, not just an implementation detail.\n\n\n\nMeta agent automates agent design and tuning: A meta agent iteratively proposes prompts, tool sets and configurations, then evaluates and edits them in a build, test, improve loop, and the production Confucius Code Agent is itself generated with this process rather than only manual tuning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the\u00a0PAPER HERE.\u00a0Also,\u00a0feel free to follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and don\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0100k+ ML SubReddit\u00a0and Subscribe to\u00a0our Newsletter.

      "content": "\nOpenAI is drawing a clearer boundary between general-purpose AI and sensitive personal data. The company is reportedly working on a new audio model and a dedicated device, while also expanding its efforts in the healthcare sector.\n\n\n\nOn January 7, the company announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated health experience within ChatGPT that allows users to securely connect personal medical records and wellness apps, while keeping health data isolated from the main chat interface.\n\n\n\nThe move reflects OpenAI\u2019s emphasis on data separation and privacy. The new health experience operates as a separate space within ChatGPT, with purpose-built encryption, data isolation and controls designed specifically for sensitive health information. \u201cConversations in Health are not used to train our foundation models,\u201d the company clarified.\n\n\n\nThe launch follows OpenAI\u2019s own data highlighting the scale of health-related use on ChatGPT. According to the company, more than 230 million people globally ask health and wellness questions on the platform every week, accounting for over 5% of all interactions.\n\n\n\nOpenAI said it is initially rolling out ChatGPT Health to a limited group of early users as it tests and refines the experience. Access will be available to users on Free, Go, Plus and Pro plans outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople come to ChatGPT to prep for appointments, understand lab results and make sense of their next steps. Health provides a dedicated space that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT\u2019s intelligence together, so you can better advocate for your health,\u201d Karan Singhal, Health AI lead at OpenAI, wrote in a post on X.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotably, OpenAI launched the benchmark HealthBench last year to evaluate the capabilities of AI systems in healthcare.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMedical Records and App Integrations&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis new feature allows users to connect medical records and wellness apps, including Apple Health, MyFitnessPal and Function, with ChatGPT to ground conversations in their own data. OpenAI said this can help users understand test results, prepare questions for clinicians, or review diet and fitness routines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMedical record integrations and some apps are currently limited to the US, and Apple Health integration requires iOS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpenAI said it has partnered with b.well, a digital health platform, which provides access to connected health data. Users can remove access to medical records or disconnect apps at any time, the company said.\n\n\n\nDr Shashank Goyal, a graduate of JJM Medical College, told AIM that from a user perspective, ChatGPT can now act as a screening mechanism. \u201cIt can give people awareness about their daily health parameters and help with early detection. Patients who are not very aware of how their body parameters fluctuate can at least understand when something is going up or down,\u201d he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI, in a blog post, clarified that Health is \u201cdesigned to support, not replace, medical care\u201d and is not intended for diagnosis or treatment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoyal added that the use of AI tools could also alter the doctor-patient relationship. On the positive side, \u201cif patients are more aware, doctors may not need to spend as much time explaining basic things,\u201d he said, adding that explaining medical issues to patients in India has traditionally been challenging.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research, told AIM that clinicians might see value in this new product. \u201cWhen a patient walks in with a clearer story, better language, and a sense of what matters, the conversation improves. Time is spent interpreting and deciding, not undoing confusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom an industry perspective, Dilip Kumar, who leads health-related investments at Rainmatter Health, said the launch could significantly change the AI health space, with many existing startups likely to lose relevance as adoption grows. \u201cI meet dozens of AI health startups every week and can tell you this is a big deal,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cMost of them will become redundant once this gets adoption\u2014medical triaging, nutrition, fitness training, rehab and mental health all in one place now.\u201d\n\n\n\nAshley Alexander, vice president of health products at OpenAI, said health information today is spread across many systems, apps and trackers, making it harder for people to manage their wellbeing. She said doctor visits are often short and far apart, leaving long gaps where patients want more help understanding their health.\n\n\n\nSharing her personal experience, Alexander said ChatGPT helped her feel more prepared and confident as she navigated her health after having a baby last year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrivacy Safeguards&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpenAI said all third-party apps available within ChatGPT Health must meet the company\u2019s privacy and security standards, including strict limits on data collection.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cApps are required to collect only the minimum data needed,\u201d the company said, adding that each integration also undergoes an additional security review before being made available in Health.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first time you connect an app, we\u2019ll help you understand what types of data may be collected by the third party. And you\u2019re always in control: disconnect an app at any time, and it immediately loses access,\u201d OpenAI added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoyal compared this with medical confidentiality, wherein conversations between doctors and patients are protected by privacy norms, and personal health details cannot be disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe launch has also drawn scepticism. \u201cThis sounds like the craziest data harvesting of the most sensitive personal data users have,\u201d Raquel de Horna, a product and marketing lead at Digital Identity, wrote on LinkedIn. She questioned how OpenAI would assure users that their health data would remain secure and not be repurposed beyond its stated use.\n\n\n\nOthers argued that concerns around data misuse need to be viewed in the broader context of how health information is already handled today. Tilden Chima, a senior cloud systems engineer, said patient data is already widely accessed across healthcare systems. \u201cHealth data is already being harvested or leaked by third-party application add-ons in electronic medical record systems,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nRajan Kashyap, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), previously told AIM that patient confidentiality is often overlooked in the healthcare industry.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI strongly advocate for strict adherence to protected data-sharing protocols when handling clinical information. In today\u2019s landscape of data warfare, where numerous companies face legal action for breaching data privacy norms, protecting health data is no less critical than protecting national security,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe risk of unintentionally exposing protected health information through AI platforms is high. AI systems are vulnerable to data breaches, hacking and the potential for re-identification even with anonymised data. According to the National Institutes of Health in the US, the risk increases due to the growing use of cloud-based AI models.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGogia said trust in health AI systems cannot be assumed and must be clearly justified. \u201cChatGPT Health remains a consumer product, not a clinically regulated system. That distinction matters,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients need to know what data is collected, how long it is stored, where it is processed and how it can be permanently removed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that ambiguity can be as damaging as a data breach. \u201cEvidence shows that trust erodes faster due to uncertainty than from a single failure,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGogia added that the real gains from tools like ChatGPT Health lie in practical, everyday improvements rather than clinical breakthroughs. However, he cautioned that there are hard limits to what conversational AI can achieve. \u201cThese tools do not create clinicians. They do not add beds. They do not reduce chronic disease burden on their own,\u201d Gogia said\n\n\n\nBy carving out health as a separate space, OpenAI is clearly distinguishing general AI use from sensitive personal data. The success of ChatGPT Health will hinge on how well that line is maintained over time.\nThe post ChatGPT Health Just Wants to Save Your Doctor\u2019s Time, Nothing More appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "From cloud to factory \u2013 humanoid robots coming to workplaces",
      "content": " The partnership announced this week between Microsoft and Hexagon Robotics marks an inflection point in the commercialisation of humanoid, AI-powered robots for industrial environments. The two companies will combine Microsoft&#8217;s cloud and AI infrastructure with Hexagon&#8217;s expertise in robotics, sensors, and spatial intelligence to advance the deployment of physical AI systems in real-world settings. \n At the centre of the collaboration is AEON, Hexagon&#8217;s industrial humanoid robot, a device designed to operate autonomously in environments like factories, logistics hubs, engineering plants, and inspection sites. \n The partnership will focus on multimodal AI training, imitation learning, real-time data management, and integration with existing industrial systems. Initial target sectors include automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, and logistics, the companies say. It&#8217;s in these industries where labour shortages and operational complexity are already constraining financial growth. \n The announcement is the sign of a maturing ecosystem: cloud platforms, physical AI, and robotics engineering&#8217;s convergence, making humanoid automation commercially viable. \nHumanoid robots out of the research lab\n While humanoid robots have been  the subject of work at research institutions, demonstrated proudly at technology events, the last five years have seen a move to practical deployment in real-world, working environments. The main change has been the combination of improved perception, advances in reinforcement and imitation learning, and the availability of scalable cloud infrastructure. \n One of the most visible examples is Agility Robotics&#8217; Digit, a bipedal humanoid robot designed for logistics and warehouse operations. Digit has been piloted in live environments by companies like Amazon, where it performs material-handling tasks including tote movement and last-metre logistics. Such deployments tend to focus on augmenting human workers rather than replacing them, with Digit handling more physically demanding tasks. \n Similarly, Tesla&#8217;s Optimus programme has moved out of the phase where concept videos were all that existed, and is now undergoing factory trials. Optimus robots are being tested on structured tasks like part handling and equipment transport inside Tesla&#8217;s automotive manufacturing facilities. While still limited in scope, these pilots demonstrate the pattern of humanoid-like machines chosen over less anthropomorphic form-factors so they can operate in human-designed and -populated spaces. \nInspection, maintenance, and hazardous environments\n Industrial inspection is emerging as one of the earliest commercially viable use cases for humanoid and quasi-humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics&#8217; Atlas, while not yet a general-purpose commercial product, has been used in live industrial trials for inspection and disaster-response environments. It can navigate uneven terrain, climb stairs, and manipulate tools in places considered unsafe for humans. \n Toyota Research Institute has deployed humanoid robotics platforms for remote inspection and manipulation tasks in similar settings. Toyota&#8217;s systems rely on multimodal perception and human-in-the-loop control, the latter reinforcing an industry trend: early deployments prioritise reliability and traceability, so need human oversight. \n Hexagon&#8217;s AEON aligns closely with this trend. Its emphasis on sensor fusion and spatial intelligence is relevant for inspection and quality assurance tasks, where precise understanding of physical environments is more valuable than the conversational abilities most associated with everyday use of AIs. \nCloud platforms central to robotics strategy\n A defining feature of the Microsoft-Hexagon partnership is the use of cloud infrastructure in the scaling of humanoid robots. Training, updating, and monitoring physical AI systems generates large quantities of data, including video, force feedback from on-device sensors, spatial mapping (such as that derived from LIDAR), and operational telemetry. Managing this data locally has historically been a bottleneck, due to storage and processing constraints. \n By using platforms like Azure and Azure IoT Operations, plus real-time intelligence services in the cloud, humanoid robots can be trained fleet-wide, not isolated units. This leads to multiple possibilities in shared learning, improvement by iteration, and greater consistency. For board-level buyers, these IT architecture shifts mean humanoid robots become viable entities that can be treated \u2013 in terms of IT requirements \u2013 more like enterprise software than machinery. \nLabour shortages drive adoption\n The demographic trends in manufacturing, logistics, and asset-intensive industries are increasingly unfavourable. Ageing workforces, declining interest in manual roles, and persistent skills shortages create skills gaps that conventional automation cannot fully address \u2013 at least, not without rebuilding entire facilities to be more suited to a robotic workforce. Fixed robotic systems excel in repetitive, predictable tasks but struggle in dynamic, human environments. \n Humanoid robots occupy a middle ground. Not designed to replace workflows, they can stabilise operations where human availability is uncertain. Case studies show early value in night shifts, periods of peak demand, and tasks deemed too hazardous for humans. \nWhat boards should evaluate before investing\n For decision-makers considering investment in next-generation workplace robots, several issues to note have emerged from existing, real-world deployments: \n Task specificity matters more than general intelligence, with the more successful pilots focusing on well-defined activities. Data governance and security continue to have to be placed front and centre when robots are put into play, especially so when it&#8217;s necessary to connect them to cloud platforms. \n At a human level, workforce integration can be more challenging than sourcing, installing, and running the technology itself. Yet human oversight remains essential at this stage in AI maturity, for safety and regulatory acceptance. \nA measured but irreversible shift\n Humanoid robots won&#8217;t replace the human workforce, but an increasing body of evidence from live deployments and prototyping shows such devices are moving into the workplace. As of now, humanoid, AI-powered robots can perform economically-valuable tasks, and integration with existing industrial systems is immensely possible. For boards with the appetite to invest, the question could be when competitors might deploy the technology responsibly and at scale. \n(Image source: Source: Hexagon Robotics)\n&nbsp;\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "title": "Inside Trump\u2019s Semiconductor Tariff Bluff",
      "content": "\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened steep tariffs on semiconductors and electronics. However, those tariffs do not take effect simply because he says they will.\n\n\n\nThe legal authority Trump relies on is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the President to impose import restrictions on national security grounds. That authority, however, is conditional.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt can only be exercised after a formal investigation by the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and a subsequent presidential determination based on the findings of that investigation.\n\n\n\nUnder Section 232, \u2018national security\u2019 has been interpreted broadly. It extends beyond military readiness to include domestic industrial capacity, supply-chain concentration and the ability to supply defence or other critical industries during a national emergency.\n\n\n\nTariffs under this framework are instruments designed to alter market incentives by raising the cost of imports, supporting domestic producers and creating leverage to shift production or sourcing decisions.\n\n\n\nAs a result, any tariff Trump has publicly endorsed\u2014including the 26% tariff on India announced last April, the reciprocal 50% tariff announced in August or the proposed 500% tariff on Russia and countries that purchase Russian oil\u2014can only be applied to industries that the DOC determines pose a national security risk under Section 232.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTariffs are applied selectively, not universally.\n\n\n\nWhere the Semiconductor Investigation Stands Today\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 2025, the DOC formally initiated a Section 232 investigation into semiconductors, the equipment used to manufacture them and the products made with them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe process included a public comment period and submissions from industry participants.\n\n\n\nBy statute, the DOC has 270 days to submit its findings. The President then has an additional 90 days to decide whether to act and to specify the nature of any trade restrictions.\n\n\n\nThat process has not yet concluded, and no findings have been issued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Reuters report published in November indicated that officials were not expected to levy semiconductor tariffs in the near term, adding that a final decision was still some distance away.\n\n\n\nFor now, the technology industry remains unaffected.\n\n\n\nThis remains true despite Trump\u2019s repeated public warnings to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Trump has said tariffs would follow if production was not moved out of China or India and into the United States, and has also stated that he would impose 100% tariffs on semiconductors while exempting companies that shift manufacturing domestically.\n\n\n\nThis legislative backdrop sits alongside other policy efforts such as the CHIPS Act, through which the US has deployed subsidies, tax incentives and investment credits to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing, signalling that incentives rather than tariffs are currently the preferred lever to build capacity.\n\n\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, a think tank focused on US foreign policy and international relations, noted in a report, \u201cThe United States relies heavily on foreign suppliers for these goods (semiconductors, the equipment used to manufacture them and the products made with them), importing over $200 billion more than it exported in 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the report highlighted that Section 232 outcomes are frequently shaped through negotiation.\n\n\n\nLiechtenstein, Switzerland and the European Union negotiated a 15% tariff ceiling on semiconductor exports, while Japan secured the lowest tariff rate among countries.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung last November illustrates this approach. The US committed that any Section 232 terms applied to South Korea would be no less favourable than those offered to countries with comparable trade volumes.\n\n\n\nFrom an Indian context, however, if tariffs are eventually applied to this industry, the impact could be significant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone exports from India crossed $50 billion by December 2025, and 71% of iPhones sold in the US are now made in India.\n\n\n\n\u201cProduction cycles would face significant disruption. Tech companies plan component orders 6-18 months ahead, and policy uncertainty breaks this entirely,\u201d said Ganesh Krishnan, an entrepreneur and partner at GrowthStory, in an interaction with AIM.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cRelocating isn\u2019t a quick fix either; moving even 10% of the supply chain from Asia to the US would take three years and $30 billion,\u201d he stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKrishnanan said the 500% tariff is primarily a negotiating lever against India\u2019s Russian oil purchases, not a serious intent to dismantle the electronics trade. \u201cBut uncertainty itself is damaging,\u201d he said, adding that the real concern for big tech companies lies in the conclusions of the investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndustry Inputs and Supply-Chain Economics Matter\n\n\n\nThe DOC\u2019s investigation process explicitly invites industry input.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrade associations, manufacturers and downstream users are encouraged to submit evidence and analysis, and a total of 154 comments were submitted in response to the request for public comment.\n\n\n\nThe Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said while the US has a \u201clegitimate national security interest in assessing its dependence on foreign suppliers for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment,\u201d any policy response must account for the complexity of global supply chains.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis, the body noted, represents \u201cbillions of dollars in existing investments by US-based companies and deep commercial relationships built over decades.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe CCIA warned that broadly applied tariffs would raise costs across the US industry and for consumers and would also \u201cundermine the investments needed to reshore or diversify the supply chain.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe association argued against \u201cbroadly-applied tariffs or import restrictions on the wide array of goods in scope,\u201d urging the DOC instead to focus narrowly on \u201csemiconductors and SME that are critical for national defence and sourced from countries of concern.\u201d\n\n\n\nDell Technologies echoed similar concerns. While supporting efforts to reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor supply chains, the company noted that US manufacturing capacity remains limited and is unable to meet demand at scale in the near term.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDell argued that the expanding domestic semiconductor production \u201crequires financial and policy facilitative efforts rather than import restrictions,\u201d warning that abrupt trade measures could raise costs, disrupt operations and delay production.\n\n\n\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) added quantitative context.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile global semiconductor sales were expected to grow in 2025, ITIF warned that moderate to severe tariffs could reverse that trajectory, pushing growth to \u201cas much as a -20% growth rate for the sector in 2025,\u201d potentially wiping out \u201csome $250-300 billion of global semiconductor sales\u201d in a single year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe analysis cautioned that higher chip prices would cascade through downstream sectors, raising costs for autos, data centres and electronics, and weakening US competitiveness rather than accelerating domestic capacity build-out.\nThe post Inside Trump\u2019s Semiconductor Tariff Bluff appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "content": "\nxAI has restricted the image-generation features of its AI model, Grok, to paid subscribers. The change was revealed through Grok\u2019s own responses to user prompts on X.\n\n\n\nThe move follows widespread government backlash over how Grok was being misused on the platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUsers on X were editing uploaded images through Grok to fulfil obscene requests. These requests were made by tagging the @grok bot, which generated and posted the edited images directly to the public feed.\n\n\n\nThe issue escalated because the generated images were publicly visible and often involved explicit sexual content. In several cases, the requests targeted real individuals, raising concerns around consent, harassment, and the circulation of non-consensual explicit material.\n\n\n\nAs a result, multiple countries\u2014including the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, France, and Ireland\u2014sent notices to Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese notices called for investigations into the generation and spread of inappropriate and obscene AI-generated images on X.\n\n\n\nData shared by AI detection firm Copyleaks highlights the scale of the problem.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the firm, users requested the creation of obscene images at a rate of roughly once per minute over a 24-hour period.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported that in a five-minute window, 102 requests were made to Grok to generate explicit images. The AI model complied with approximately one in five of those requests.\n\n\n\nHaving said that, X stated in a comment that the company will take action against illegal content on X, \u201cincluding Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few days ago, India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) intervened and issued a notice to X, directing it to remove obscene content and flagging concerns over the misuse of Grok.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter addressed to X\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer for India, the Ministry flagged that Grok was being exploited by users to create fake accounts that host, generate, publish, or share obscene images and videos of women in a derogatory and vulgar manner.\n\n\n\nThe company was given time until February 7th to submit a detailed report. However, a report from The Times of India states that the ministry is not fully satisfied with the company\u2019s initial response, and is \u201clikely to seek clearer, step-by-step details on corrective measures the platform plan to implement.\u201d\nThe post X Limits Grok Image Tools to Paid Users After Global Govt Backlash appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "content": "\nAn engineer at the AI-powered app development platform Lovable said in a LinkedIn post that a series of changes to the company\u2019s system prompt helped cut annual large language model (LLM) costs by nearly $20 million, while also improving performance.\n\n\n\nBenjamin Verbeek, a member of technical staff at Lovable, explaining that he spent the holiday period reviewing and improving the platform\u2019s system prompt. According to Verbeek, the changes made Lovable about 4% faster.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe crazy part is that this also ended up decreasing our LLM costs by $20M per year\u2014with help from my mother,\u201d Verbeek wrote.\n\n\n\nHe explained that when his mother\u2014who is a historian by training\u2014asked him to explain his work in the LLM space. He showed her an LLM trace, which is a detailed record of how an AI model processes instructions and generates responses step by step.\n\n\n\nLooking at the trace, Verbeek said his mother asked why certain instructions were repeated multiple times across different parts of the prompt.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we realised is that our system prompt is constructed dynamically from lots of different files,\u201d Verbeek added. \u201cAs we&#8217;ve been optimising each part, no one had looked at the coherence for a while. Together we found duplication, inconsistencies, and overly verbose formulations.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe explained that over time, engineers had kept adding new instructions to emphasise specific behaviours, without removing or consolidating older ones.\n\n\n\nThis led to unnecessary repetition and diluted the prompt&#8217;s overall effectiveness.\n\n\n\nVerbeek said the team removed duplicate instructions, tightened the language, and preserved the original intent and balance of constraints.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter manually rewriting the first sections, he used an AI model to refactor the remaining portions in the same style, followed by a detailed line-by-line review to reintroduce a few critical safeguards.\n\n\n\nThe revised prompt was then A/B tested over the New Year period.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to Verbeek, the updated system followed instructions more reliably, responded faster, and significantly reduced token usage, leading to substantial cost savings at scale.\n\n\n\nReflecting on the experience, Verbeek highlighted three key takeaways.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirstly, he said that prompt quality compounds at scale. He also noted that fresh perspectives can outperform simply \u201cprompting harder.\u201d Lastly, he pointed out that fast, safe experimentation is a major advantage in AI development.\n\n\n\nHowever, one user pointed to a recent Google research paper suggesting that prompt repetition can, in some cases, improve the performance of large language models without increasing output length or latency.\n\n\n\nResponding to the comment, Verbeek said that repetition can indeed be beneficial in certain contexts, but stressed that Lovable\u2019s advantage lies in its ability to run high-confidence experiments to validate such claims. \u201cIn our conditions, this happened to work really well,\u201d he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast December, Lovable raised $330 million in a Series B funding round at a valuation of $6.6 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLovable said the capital will be used to deepen integrations with enterprise software tools, expand collaboration and governance features for teams, and strengthen infrastructure that supports moving products from prototype to production.\nThe post Lovable Engineer Saves Company $20 Mn Yearly With Help From His Mother appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

But Americans will have to speak upOver the past year, Elon Musk has made a series of protocol changes to Grok, the proprietary AI chatbot of his company xAI, which runs prominently on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. Many of these changes have been geared to make the bot more amenable to producing pornography. In August, Grok launched an image generator, branded as Grok Imagine, which featured a service geared toward creating nude, suggestive or sexually explicit content, including computer-generated pornographic images of real women. The feature, which was quickly used to create naked images of celebrities such as Taylor Swift, also allowed users to create brief videos, complete with animations and sounds.Musk also rolled out AI girlfriends on the platform: animated personas \u2013 including female characters with exaggerated breasts and hips \u2013 that interacted in sexually explicit ways with users. One of the characters, \u201cAni\u201d, was an anime-style cartoon blonde with a series of skimpy outfits; the bot blew kisses and addressed users as \u201cmy love\u201d while directing the chats toward sexual content.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistThis article was updated on 9 January 2026 to note that Grok said the image-generating service had been turned off for users who do not subscribe.

      "content": "Integrating AI into code review workflows allows engineering leaders to detect systemic risks that often evade human detection at scale.\n\n\n\nFor engineering leaders managing distributed systems, the trade-off between deployment speed and operational stability often defines the success of their platform. Datadog, a company responsible for the observability of complex infrastructures worldwide, operates under intense pressure to maintain this balance.\n\n\n\nWhen a client\u2019s systems fail, they rely on Datadog\u2019s platform to diagnose the root cause\u2014meaning reliability must be established well before software reaches a production environment.\n\n\n\nScaling this reliability is an operational challenge. Code review has traditionally acted as the primary gatekeeper, a high-stakes phase where senior engineers attempt to catch errors. However, as teams expand, relying on human reviewers to maintain deep contextual knowledge of the entire codebase becomes unsustainable.\n\n\n\nTo address this bottleneck, Datadog\u2019s AI Development Experience (AI DevX) team integrated OpenAI\u2019s Codex, aiming to automate the detection of risks that human reviewers frequently miss.\n\n\n\nWhy static analysis falls short\n\n\n\nThe enterprise market has long utilised automated tools to assist in code review, but their effectiveness has historically been limited.\n\n\n\nEarly iterations of AI code review tools often performed like &#8220;advanced linters,&#8221; identifying superficial syntax issues but failing to grasp the broader system architecture. Because these tools lacked the ability to understand context, engineers at Datadog frequently dismissed their suggestions as noise.\n\n\n\nThe core issue was not detecting errors in isolation, but understanding how a specific change might ripple through interconnected systems. Datadog required a solution capable of reasoning over the codebase and its dependencies, rather than simply scanning for style violations.\n\n\n\nThe team integrated the new agent directly into the workflow of one of their most active repositories, allowing it to review every pull request automatically. Unlike static analysis tools, this system compares the developer&#8217;s intent with the actual code submission, executing tests to validate behaviour.\n\n\n\nFor CTOs and CIOs, the difficulty in adopting generative AI often lies in proving its value beyond theoretical efficiency. Datadog bypassed standard productivity metrics by creating an &#8220;incident replay harness&#8221; to test the tool against historical outages.\n\n\n\nInstead of relying on hypothetical test cases, the team reconstructed past pull requests that were known to have caused incidents. They then ran the AI agent against these specific changes to determine if it would have flagged the issues that humans missed in their code reviews.\n\n\n\nThe results provided a concrete data point for risk mitigation: the agent identified over 10 cases (approximately 22% of the examined incidents) where its feedback would have prevented the error. These were pull requests that had already bypassed human review, demonstrating that the AI surfaced risks invisible to the engineers at the time.\n\n\n\nThis validation changed the internal conversation regarding the tool&#8217;s utility. Brad Carter, who leads the AI DevX team, noted that while efficiency gains are welcome, \u201cpreventing incidents is far more compelling at our scale.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow AI code reviews are changing engineering culture\n\n\n\nThe deployment of this technology to more than 1,000 engineers has influenced the culture of code review within the organisation. Rather than replacing the human element, the AI serves as a partner that handles the cognitive load of cross-service interactions.\n\n\n\nEngineers reported that the system consistently flagged issues that were not obvious from the immediate code difference. It identified missing test coverage in areas of cross-service coupling and pointed out interactions with modules that the developer had not touched directly.\n\n\n\nThis depth of analysis changed how the engineering staff interacted with automated feedback.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me, a Codex comment feels like the smartest engineer I\u2019ve worked with and who has infinite time to find bugs. It sees connections my brain doesn\u2019t hold all at once,\u201d explains Carter.\n\n\n\nThe AI code review system\u2019s ability to contextualise changes allows human reviewers to shift their focus from catching bugs to evaluating architecture and design.\n\n\n\nFrom bug hunting to reliability\n\n\n\nFor enterprise leaders, the Datadog case study illustrates a transition in how code review is defined. It is no longer viewed merely as a checkpoint for error detection or a metric for cycle time, but as a core reliability system.\n\n\n\nBy surfacing risks that exceed individual context, the technology supports a strategy where confidence in shipping code scales alongside the team. This aligns with the priorities of Datadog\u2019s leadership, who view reliability as a fundamental component of customer trust.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are the platform companies rely on when everything else is breaking,\u201d says Carter. \u201cPreventing incidents strengthens the trust our customers place in us\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe successful integration of AI into the code review pipeline suggests that the technology\u2019s highest value in the enterprise may lie in its ability to enforce complex quality standards that protect the bottom line.\n\n\n\nSee also: Agentic AI scaling requires new memory architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "title": "How Dell\u2019s GB10 Signals the Shift Towards Real On-Device AI",
      "content": "\nFor years, the AI community expected progress to come only from bigger clusters and larger cloud deployments.\n\n\n\nInstead, a parallel trend has reshaped how developers build models, leading to small and mid-sized language models becoming dramatically more capable.\n\n\n\nThis shift has reopened an old question with new urgency: If developers can do more with smaller models, why is much of AI development still locked behind remote, expensive and capacity-constrained infrastructure?\n\n\n\nLocal computing has struggled to keep pace. Even top-end workstations hit memory ceilings well before loading these improved models.\n\n\n\nTeams working on 30B or 70B parameter models often find that their hardware forces them to use compression techniques, model sharding or external GPU servers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor regulated industries, none of those workarounds are straightforward because moving data off-premise is restricted. For researchers and startups, accessing cloud instances becomes a recurring drain on budgets and iteration velocity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe gap between what models can do and what local machines can support has grown wider.\n\n\n\nTo address challenges in this space, hardware manufacturers like Dell have invested significant effort. The company\u2019s latest Dell Pro Max with GB10 is a response to developers capable of building more ambitious on-device AI but blocked by hardware limits.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cTraining models with more than 70 billion parameters demands computational resources far beyond what most high-end workstations deliver,\u201d the company said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy bringing NVIDIA\u2019s Grace Blackwell architecture\u2014previously limited to data centres\u2014into a deskside form factor, Dell is attempting to realign hardware with this new generation of compact but computationally demanding AI workloads.\n\n\n\nThe Dell Pro Max with GB10 ships with 128GB of unified LPDDR5X memory and runs on Ubuntu Linux with NVIDIA DGX OS, preconfigured with CUDA, Docker, JupyterLab and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise stack.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDell says the system delivers up to 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of FP4 AI performance, giving developers the headroom to fine-tune and prototype models up to 200B parameters locally.\u201cPacking this much power into a compact 1.2-kg device, measuring just 150 mm by 150 mm by 50.5 mm, represents a significant engineering achievement,\u201d the company stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBesides, unified memory avoids many bottlenecks that arise from juggling separate CPU/GPU memory pools and lets developers work with large models in a single address space.\n\n\n\nThe value is practical rather than theoretical. Academic labs can run Meta\u2019s open source Llama-class models without waiting for shared clusters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStartups can experiment with product features locally instead of committing to cloud spend during early R&amp;D. Banks and healthcare organisations can build AI systems while keeping data inside their compliance perimeter. Independent developers can test and refine models that were previously out of reach without renting external GPUs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Dell put it, the Pro Max with GB10 is designed to \u201cstreamline development\u201d and eliminate the recurring problem of local devices hitting their limits too early in the workflow.\n\n\n\nWhen working with larger-scale AI workloads, Dell also shared a potential solution. \u201cTeams that need more capacity can bond two GB10 systems to act as a single node, accommodating models of up to 400 billion parameters,\u201d Dell stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt added that teams can get started quickly as DGX OS comes preconfigured. They can launch training jobs within minutes, use additional SDKs and orchestration tools as needed, and pull model checkpoints directly from the NVIDIA Developer portal and the NGC catalogue.\n\n\n\nIt is an AI development node, and a tool for running and iterating on models directly, not an all-purpose PC. Teams without experience in machine learning stacks or DGX-style workflows will face a learning curve.\n\n\n\nStill, the direction is consistent with how the AI ecosystem is shifting. As more capable smaller models emerge, on-device AI is becoming viable for tasks that previously required remote compute. Developers want faster iteration, predictable costs and greater control over data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe device exists to meet those conditions. It does not replace large clusters for final training runs, but it changes what can happen locally in the earliest, most experimental stages.\n\n\n\n\u201cPersonal computers have brought software development to everyone. Cloud computing has made large-scale apps easy to access,\u201d Dell added. \u201cNow, desktop supercomputing will make advanced AI engineering possible for anyone ready to explore.\u201d\nThe post How Dell\u2019s GB10 Signals the Shift Towards Real On-Device AI appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called \"content chunking\" may fall into that category.

The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.\nAccording to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn't use such signals to improve ranking. \"One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?\" said Sullivan. \"So... we don't want you to do that.\"Read full article\nComments",

By the time we get to the fifth story, I need a real architect to take over. \nBut AI enables a new kind of software, one that\u2019s more like growing a garden than it is building a skyscraper. I\u2019ve been calling it an agent-native architecture\u2014and we\u2019ve pivoted our whole software strategy at Every around it.\nThe core of an agent-native architecture is not code. Instead, as the name implies, the core is an agent\u2014something squishy and alive, planted in sun and soil. Each feature of the app is a prompt to the agent that names the result to achieve, not a set of steps to follow. That\u2019s why I often think of agent-native apps as Claude Code in a trenchcoat. \nClick here to read the full postWant the full text of all articles in RSS? Become a subscriber, or learn more.",

      "title": "Autonomy without accountability: The real AI risk",
      "content": "If you have ever taken a self-driving Uber through downtown LA, you might recognise the strange sense of uncertainty that settles in when there is no driver and no conversation, just a quiet car making assumptions about the world around it. The journey feels fine until the car misreads a shadow or slows abruptly for something harmless. In that moment you see the real issue with autonomy. It does not panic when it should, and that gap between confidence and judgement is where trust is either earned or lost. Much of today&#8217;s enterprise AI feels remarkably similar. It is competent without being confident, and efficient without being empathetic, which is why the deciding factor in every successful deployment is no longer computing power but trust.\n\n\n\nThe MLQ State of AI in Business 2025 [PDF] report puts a sharp number on this. 95% of early AI pilots fail to produce measurable ROI, not because the technology is weak but because it is mismatched to the problems organisations are trying to solve. The pattern repeats itself in industries. Leaders get uneasy when they can&#8217;t tell if the output is right, teams are unsure whether dashboards can be trusted, and customers quickly lose patience when an interaction feels automated rather than supported. Anyone who has been locked out of their bank account while the automated recovery system insists their answers are wrong knows how quickly confidence evaporates.\n\n\n\nKlarna remains the most publicised example of large-scale automation in action. The company has now halved its workforce since 2022 and says internal AI systems are performing the work of 853 full-time roles, up from 700 earlier this year. Revenues have risen 108%, while average employee compensation has increased 60%, funded in part by those operational gains. Yet the picture is more complicated. Klarna still reported a 95 million dollar quarterly loss, and its CEO has warned that further staff reductions are likely. It shows that automation alone does not create stability. Without accountability and structure, the experience breaks down long before the AI does. As Jason Roos, CEO of CCaaS provider Cirrus, puts it, &#8220;Any transformation that unsettles confidence, inside or outside the business, carries a cost you cannot ignore. it can leave you worse off.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWe have already seen what happens when autonomy runs ahead of accountability. The UK&#8217;s Department for Work and Pensions used an algorithm that wrongly flagged around 200,000 housing-benefit claims as potentially fraudulent, even though the majority were legitimate. The problem wasn&#8217;t the technology. It was the absence of clear ownership over its decisions. When an automated system suspends the wrong account, rejects the wrong claim or creates unnecessary fear, the issue is never just &#8220;why did the model misfire?&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;who owns the outcome?&#8221; Without that answer, trust becomes fragile.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The missing step is always readiness,&#8221; says Roos. &#8220;If the process, the data and the guardrails aren&#8217;t in place, autonomy doesn&#8217;t accelerate performance, it amplifies the weaknesses. Accountability has to come first. Start with the outcome, find where effort is being wasted, check your readiness and governance, and only then automate. Skip those steps and accountability disappears just as fast as the efficiency gains arrive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPart of the problem is an obsession with scale without the grounding that makes scale sustainable. Many organisations push toward autonomous agents that can act decisively, yet very few pause to consider what happens when those actions drift outside expected boundaries. The Edelman Trust Barometer [PDF] shows a steady decline in public trust in AI over the past five years, and a joint KPMG and University of Melbourne study found that workers prefer more human involvement in almost half the tasks examined. The findings reinforce a simple point. Trust rarely comes from pushing models harder. It comes from people taking the time to understand how decisions are made, and from governance that behaves less like a brake pedal and more like a steering wheel.\n\n\n\nThe same dynamics appear on the customer side. PwC&#8217;s trust research reveals a wide gulf between perception and reality. Most executives believe customers trust their organisation, while only a minority of customers agree. Other surveys show that transparency helps to close this gap, with large majorities of consumers wanting clear disclosure when AI is used in service experiences. Without that clarity, people do not feel reassured. They feel misled, and the relationship becomes strained. Companies that communicate openly about their AI use are not only protecting trust but also normalising the idea that technology and human support can co-exist.\n\n\n\nSome of the confusion stems from the term &#8220;agentic AI&#8221; itself. Much of the market treats it as something unpredictable or self-directing, when in reality it is workflow automation with reasoning and recall. It is a structured way for systems to make modest decisions inside parameters designed by people. The deployments that scale safely all follow the same sequence. They start with the outcome they want to improve, then look at where unnecessary effort sits in the workflow, then assess whether their systems and teams are ready for autonomy, and only then choose the technology. Reversing that order does not speed anything up. It simply creates faster mistakes. As Roos says, AI should expand human judgement, not replace it.\n\n\n\nAll of this points toward a wider truth. Every wave of automation eventually becomes a social question rather than a purely technical one. Amazon built its dominance through operational consistency, but it also built a level of confidence that the parcel would arrive. When that confidence dips, customers move on. AI follows the same pattern. You can deploy sophisticated, self-correcting systems, but if the customer feels tricked or misled at any point, the trust breaks. Internally, the same pressures apply. The KPMG global study [PDF] highlights how quickly employees disengage when they do not understand how decisions are made or who is accountable for them. Without that clarity, adoption stalls.\n\n\n\nAs agentic systems take on more conversational roles, the emotional dimension becomes even more significant. Early reviews of autonomous chat interactions show that people now judge their experience not only by whether they were helped but also by whether the interaction felt attentive and respectful. A customer who feels dismissed rarely keeps the frustration to themselves. The emotional tone of AI is becoming a genuine operational factor, and systems that cannot meet that expectation risk becoming liabilities.\n\n\n\nThe difficult truth is that technology will continue to move faster than people&#8217;s instinctive comfort with it. Trust will always lag behind innovation. That is not an argument against progress. It is an argument for maturity. Every AI leader should be asking whether they would trust the system with their own data, whether they can explain its last decision in plain language, and who steps in when something goes wrong. If those answers are unclear, the organisation is not leading transformation. It is preparing an apology.\n\n\n\nRoos puts it simply, &#8220;Agentic AI is not the concern. Unaccountable AI is.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWhen trust goes, adoption goes, and the project that looked transformative becomes another entry in the 95% failure rate. Autonomy is not the enemy. Forgetting who is responsible is. The organisations that keep a human hand on the wheel will be the ones still in control when the self-driving hype eventually fades.\nThe post Autonomy without accountability: The real AI risk appeared first on AI News.",
