      "content": "#PaperADay 2\n2026: Deep Delta Learning https://t.co/nKj9NE1ri6\n\nThe standard residual network blocks are limited to adding on top of the existing state, which limits the expressivity of each layer. It is still a universal approximator, but we can always hope for function blocks that are more parameter / performance / training efficient.\n\nThis paper proposes a new block based on generalizing the Householder matrix so that the state can be partially or completely collapsed onto (or past) a hyperplane in addition to having new values added on top. This allows information along a vector to be multiplicatively erased while a different vector is added.\n\nThis is an all-math, no-experiments paper, which usually doesn\u2019t bode well.\n\nThe same scalar gates both the directional collapse and the value addition. Those might be better off independent, like input and forget gates in an LSTM.\n\nWhen the gating vector is 0.0, the layer is an identity. At 1.0, the previous state has been collapsed onto the learnable hyperplane before adding the new value, and at 2.0 the previous state has been reflected across the hyperplane.\n\nThey force the gate scalar to be bounded between 0 and 2 by using 2*sigmoid, but that means that default initializations will tend to project everything onto the plane, collapsing values quickly, and you can\u2019t actually reach a perfect identity.\n\nIs it actually necessary to bound the gate value? Letting it extend past those bounds just results in scaling along the vector, and avoids the sigmoid gradient issues.\n\nThey normalize the reflection direction after calculating it with an MLP, which can cause some learning dynamics issues since the weight norm can grow without bound, which reduces the effective learning rate with Adam.",

      "content": "My favorite AI models/tools for different tasks right now:\n\n1) Go-to starter: Claude Opus 4.5 - I continue to be stunned by its capabilities. It gets me. It passes the vibe check with flying colors. It matches my writing at 85-93%. I added a Claude Max account to my Team account just to use it more (and because Anthropic hates Team users). Downsides are that it runs out of context fast and that it jumps to action (like making a slide deck) too often when I don't want it to. \n\n2) Daily doer: Claude Code - I feel like a powerful conductor, wielding multiple terminals, building anything that pops into my mind, morphing my computer into the right interface at the right time. Mostly a terminal user, but will eventually go into Chrome more.\n\n3) Long tasks with lots of context: Google Gemini 3 Pro/NotebookLM - I remain obsessed with NotebookLM and love that it takes in links. I regularly upload YouTube links to those 2h or 4h long podcasts and 'talk' to the podcast guest. 200K tokens in Claude and ChatGPT just runs out too fast.\n\n4) Image anything - Nano Banana Pro. Holy cow. I made a fun PPT for my team and used NBP to make every single dynamic slide background. Infographics are the best, even with a few text issues. Would not call it enterprise-grade due to text inconsistencies. \n\n5) Video - tie between Sora and Veo 3, with Veo 3 slightly ahead. This is not a common use case for me. Really just to make memes. I prioritize convenience very highly here, and the Sora app is easy. I don't scroll the Sora app, however. Used it for 3 days and stopped. Maybe I'm not the right demographic. \n\n6) Voice anything - Whisper API, followed by Wispr Flow and Otter AI tied for second. Gemini a distant third. Anthropic fading into the deep darkness in fourth and forgotten place. Siri buried under the floorboards.\n\n7) Talking to multiple documents - NotebookLM\n\n8) Extra efficiency hacks - Claude Skills, Claude brain dump folder for terminal comms, Wispr Flow into multiple CC terminals, Stream Deck with AI shortcuts, prompt text replacement shortcuts, Oculus Quest headset for extra focus, airplane mode, blue light blocking glasses, headlamp (I know that last one sounds insane)",

Tasks - You can spin up separate conversation threads without losing your primary work. One task is debugging, another is exploring a new feature, and a third is doing research. Switch between them instantly.\n\n2. Workspaces - Each workspace is an isolated coding environment with its own branch, commit history, and modifications. You can literally build two different implementations of the same feature side by side, then decide which one to merge.\n\nI really like the idea of having parallelization baked into the tool itself.

Very rules-based traditional systems, similar to Nest. \n\nLLM integration was surprisingly low. Exception: cute physical AI companions. Sharp's Poketomo is a 4.5\" fuzzy meerkat with a slew of little outfits that chats with you. Also got a private demo of Razer's Project Ava, a 5.5\" hologram desk companion powered by Grok.\n\nHealth tech and accessibility tech had strong showings.

This book explores these threats in depth, equipping cybersecurity professionals with the tools needed to secure generative AI and LLM applications. Rather than skimming the surface of emerging risks, it focuses on practical strategies, industry standards, and recent research to build a robust defense framework.\n\nStructured around actionable insights, the chapters introduce a secure-by-design methodology, integrating threat modeling and MLSecOps practices to fortify AI systems. You\u2019ll discover how to leverage established taxonomies from OWASP, NIST, and MITRE to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Through real-world examples, the book highlights best practices for incorporating security controls into AI development life cycles, covering key areas such as CI/CD, MLOps, and open-access LLMs.\"",

What were your step rates like?\n\nThe ant\u2019s limbs may be modeled in 3D, but that is irrelevant to the environment \u2014 it is just a 2D point that has a very funny control scheme.\n\nI conflated the grid and ant observations, but relative XY positions for the targets is even easier than a one-hot grid. I get the reasoning behind just going one small step beyond a grid world to make a minimal demonstration of the concept, I just suspect that many people that saw the video go by on X ascribed more capability to the agent than was actually there.\n\nI understand the boundaries of the options are learned, but the expert trajectories were generated with 1-of-4 steering, and the agent only has to classify the actions into 1-of-4 options, or just any permutation of the original set. If it was given the capability to learn 16 actions, would it find new divisions? That is directly relevant to my interests: if an agent learns from scratch, can it usefully identify the emergent longer temporal action sets in its own behavior, versus from an expert that explicitly had categorical behaviors.\n\nThank you for the clarifications!",

We also show experiments this idea works very well when we want to detect data contamination or leaderboard hacking. \n\nOur idea is an improvement over naively adding label noise to the answers, because the label noise approach will weaken the ability to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs and track their improvements.  \"",
