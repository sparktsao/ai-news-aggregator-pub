      "content": "Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq&#8217;s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on recordNvidia agreed to license Groq&#8217;s inference technology and acquire essentially all of its assets for about $20 billion in cash&#8212;its largest deal to date&#8212;according to Disruptive CEO Alex Davis, a major Groq investor. Groq, valued at $6.9 billion after raising $750 million three months ago, said it entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia and that CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior leaders will join Nvidia. In a note to employees, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the plan is to integrate Groq&#8217;s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture to broaden support for inference and real-time workloads. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress declined comment, and Huang emphasized Nvidia is licensing Groq&#8217;s IP and hiring talent, not acquiring the company itself. Groq will continue operating independently under CFO-turned-CEO Simon Edwards, with GroqCloud excluded from the transaction and continuing without interruption. Davis said Nvidia is receiving all of Groq&#8217;s assets aside from the nascent cloud business, effectively transferring the core chip IP and hardware. OpenAI opens ChatGPT to third-party apps via its PlatformOpenAI is now accepting submissions for third-party apps inside ChatGPT, creating an app directory where approved tools are discoverable and usable directly in the ChatGPT interface. Developers can submit apps built with OpenAI models through the developer platform; listings undergo automated and manual review for policy compliance, safety, and technical reliability before approval. Once approved, apps appear alongside built-in tools and can be invoked in conversational workflows without external installs. The rollout is global, and eligibility depends on adherence to usage policies and quality guidelines, transitioning the prior ad hoc GPT sharing toward a structured marketplace.Amazon has a new leader for its &#8216;AGI&#8217; group as it plays catch-up on AIFrom left to right: David Luan, VP of Autonomy and head of Amazon&#8217;s AGI SF Lab, and Pieter Abbeel, Amazon Scholar, Robotics.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Rohit Prasad, head of the company&#8217;s AGI efforts and longtime Alexa leader, will leave next year as Amazon hits what he called an &#8220;inflection point&#8221; in AI. Peter DeSantis, an SVP at AWS with deep infrastructure experience, will now lead a new division spanning advanced AI models, custom chip development, and quantum computing. The reshuffle puts renowned AI researcher Pieter Abbeel in charge of the frontier model research team, while DeSantis unifies Amazon&#8217;s AI stack from models to hardware. Microsoft, Google Join US AI Genesis Mission to Advance Scientific DiscoveryTwo dozen major AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon Web Services, and Google, have joined the Trump administration's \"Genesis Mission,\" a federal initiative aimed at accelerating scientific discovery and energy innovation through artificial intelligence. Announced via executive order last month, the program will coordinate research across government agencies and leverage the Energy Department's national laboratories' computing resources to automate experiment design, speed up simulations, and generate predictive models for breakthroughs in energy, manufacturing, and drug discovery. John Carreyrou and other authors bring new lawsuit against six major AI companiesRelated:Adobe hit with proposed class-action, accused of misusing authors&#8217; work in AI trainingA new lawsuit filed by authors including John Carreyrou targets Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, alleging the companies trained large language models on pirated copies of their books. The complaint argues that prior relief&#8212;namely the Anthropic $1.5 billion settlement offering roughly $3,000 per eligible writer&#8212;fails to address the &#8220;massive willful infringement&#8221; of using stolen books to build models that generate billions in revenue. This follows a judge&#8217;s earlier ruling that while training on pirated copies may be legal under current interpretations, the underlying act of book piracy is not, leaving a gap authors want courts to address directly. The plaintiffs say the proposed Anthropic settlement &#8220;serves the AI companies, not creators,&#8221; and seek accountability specifically for training on datasets sourced from infringing repositories.In a parallel suit, Adobe faces a proposed class action alleging it trained its SlimLM small language model on SlimPajama-627B, which the complaint says is a derivative of RedPajama that includes the Books3 corpus of 191,000 books. Plaintiff Elizabeth Lyon claims her guidebooks appeared in a processed subset of SlimPajama, arguing Adobe relied on a deduplicated, multi-corpora dataset that nonetheless incorporated Books3 via RedPajama copying and manipulation. Books3 and RedPajama have repeatedly surfaced in litigation, including cases naming Apple Intelligence and Salesforce for alleged training on copyrighted works &#8220;without consent and without credit or compensation.&#8221;Other NewsToolsGoogle launches Gemini 3 Flash, makes it the default model in the Gemini app. Google&#8217;s new Flash model is cheaper and faster than its predecessor, matches or exceeds top models on several benchmarks, and is rolling out as the default in the Gemini app and via Vertex AI/enterprise APIs, with previews for developers and enterprises.OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-5.2-Codex advances software engineering with better reasoning and context understanding.
