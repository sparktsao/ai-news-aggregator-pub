I refer you to what I said when we launched ARC-AGI-2 last year (which is also the same thing I said when we announced ARC-AGI-2 was coming, in Spring 2022, before the rise of LLM chatbots)...\n\nThe ARC-AGI series is not an AGI threshold, it's a compass that points the research community toward the right questions.\n\nARC-AGI-1 is a minimal test of fluid intelligence -- to pass it, you needed to show nonzero fluid intelligence. This required AI to move past the classic deep learning / LLM paradigm of pretraining scaling + static models at inference, toward test-time adaptation.\n\nARC-AGI-2 is the same, but with tasks that probe deeper levels of reasoning complexity (particularly with regard to concept composition). Still, these are tasks that are solvable in minutes by regular people with no external tool use (we hired our test takers off the street), so it does not represent the upper bound of what human fluid intelligence can achieve (say, solving a Millennium problem).\n\nARC-AGI-3 (launching March 2026) probes interactive reasoning: we evaluate how systems explore unknown environments, model them, set their own goals, and plan/execute towards these goals, autonomously, without instructions.\n\nWe have also started work on ARC-AGI-4 and ARC-AGI-5, which I am pretty excited about!",

      "content": "Announcing NVIDIA Christmas Largest Acquisition $20 Billion Groq with GPU n LPU\n\nBy acquiring Groq's licensing assets for $20 billion, Nvidia has effectively bought the inference market just as it owns the training market.\n\nHow Groq Benefits NVIDIA:\n\nIt solves the GPU Efficiency inference problem. Until yesterday, the biggest knock against Nvidia was that its GPUs were not suitable for inference (running the model), and therefore, there was a claim that GPUs consume more power than specialized ASIC chips from Google TPUs, Broadcom, and Marvel.\n\nThe Integration of LPU: Groq’s LPU (Large Language Model Processing Unit) architecture is deterministic meaning it doesn't use the complex dynamic scheduling that GPUs use for training. It pushes data through linearly, which is perfect for LLMs (which generate one token after another). Jonathan Ross, CEO of Groq, is the principal architect of TPU, who was credited as the inventor and key designer of Google's first-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a specialized AI chip, which he began as a 20% project at Google before leaving to found Groq, where he now leads the development of the Large Language Model Processing Unit (LPU).\n\nSpeed and Latency: Groq’s tech is famous for low latency (instant response) and high token throughput. By licensing this, Nvidia can integrate this instant speed architecture into its next gen chip, most likely the Vera Rubin or post-Rubin chip architecture, specifically for inference workloads by 2029 or 2030 and beyond.\n\nNVIDIA already has 90% of the GPU market share. The old argument: Don't buy Nvidia for inference; it may not be optimized. Buy our custom ASIC (Google TPU/Marvell/Broadcom) because it's specialized just for running inference for large language models.\n\nThe Reality: Nvidia now owns the world's best specialized architecture (Groq). If Nvidia integrates Groq's logic into its NIM (Nvidia Inference Microservices) or future silicon, it takes over the efficiency gap. NVIDIA becomes both the compiler and the runtime. NVIDIA becomes both the hyperscale training platform and the edge optimized inference fabric.\n\nMaking Inference So Good with Native CUDA. This is the moat expander. Groq’s biggest weakness was that it wasn't compatible with CUDA (Nvidia's native software stack). Developers had to use Groq's custom compiler.\n\nThe CUDA Wrapper: Nvidia will likely take Groq’s deterministic scheduling and wrap it inside CUDA native software AI stack.\n\nThe Result: A developer can write standard Nvidia code, but the hardware will execute it with Groq-like speed and efficiency. You get the performance of a custom chip with the ease of use of Nvidia's standard software. It optimizes the switching cost friction that stopped people from using Groq before.\n\nNVIDIA just raised the bar so high that good enough custom chips might not cut it anymore.\n\nThe Competitor List in the market:\n\nBroadcom and Marvell: They make custom chips for Google/Meta/OpenAI.\nHyperscaler Internal Chip: AWS (Inferentia/Trainium), Google (TPU), Microsoft (Maia).\nAMD: MI-series chips.\nCerebras / SambaNova: Other niche AI chip startup(s).\n\nASIC Chip: These competitors relied on being cheaper and more power efficient than Nvidia GPUs. If Nvidia uses Groq's tech to optimize inference power consumption by 50-80% while boosting speed, the ROI of designing a custom chip with Broadcom and Marvell plummets instantly. Why build your own spending so many years if Nvidia already delivers you a standard chip with the NVIDIA ecosystem with a better inference chip that runs all your software?\n\nhttps://t.co/5mN67tlHEU \nhttps://t.co/xw0zuYQxiJ\n\n#BigData #Analytics #DataScience #AI #MachineLearning #NLProc #LLM #IoT #IIoT #PyTorch #Python #RStats #TensorFlow #Java #JavaScript #ReactJS #GoLang #CloudComputing #Serverless #DataScientist #Linux #Programming #Coding #100DaysofCode",

      "content": "Outstanding Paper at ICLR 2025.\n\nCurrent LLM safety training is surprisingly fragile—adversarial prompts, decoding tricks, and minimal finetuning can all bypass it. This paper explains why: safety alignment only teaches the model to start responses with refusals. If an attacker forces the model to begin with something else—like \"Sure, here's how\"—the rest of the generation proceeds as if safety training never happened.\n\nThe authors proposed two fixes.\n\nFirst, they augmented training data with synthetic examples where a harmful prompt is followed by a few harmful tokens, then pivots to a refusal—teaching the model to recover even mid-response.\n\nSecond, they designed a finetuning loss that penalizes changes to the first few token positions while leaving later tokens free to adapt. This is meant for API providers offering finetuning services: users can still customize models for downstream tasks, but the safety-critical early tokens resist modification.\n\nRead with Q&A on ChapterPal: https://t.co/BQcobQ3Pre\n\nDownload PDF: https://t.co/R2nYUDlkhT",
