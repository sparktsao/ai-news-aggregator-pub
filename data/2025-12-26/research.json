      "content": "Thanks to Jordan Taylor and Sohaib Imran for helping to make this post better.If you are a researcher who wants to work on one of the directions or a funder who wants to fund one, feel free to reach out to me. I've been thinking for a while on many of the proposals and would love to share more context on them.Eval awareness is important and under-researched!I work on evaluation awareness. I study whether models can tell when they're being evaluated and how this affects their behavior during evaluations. The issue is pressing: models rapidly become more and more eval aware. For example, Anthropic evaluated Sonnet 4.5 on their alignment tests, and&nbsp;they found that the rate of misalignment had dropped to almost 0% compared to 10% of Claude Sonnet 4.1, but Sonnet 4.5 mentioned in these evals that it's being evaluated in more than 80% of its transcripts, and steering the model against eval awareness reduced mentions of eval awareness in transcripts and caused the model to show some misaligned behavior, which means that their evals were likely to be a better measure of eval awareness than measure of alignment.There is some research that measures evaluation awareness in models, but not so much research exploring how and why do models acquire the capability to recognize evaluations, and this post is a call to the community to do such research, and propose concrete research directions that I believe to be useful.If we want reliable safety evaluations, we need to understand how evaluation awareness develops and how to reduce it.Lack of science of eval awarenessCurrently people approach the topic of evaluation awareness from several angles:Black-box measurement methods: for example, direct questioning: \"Does this prompt look like an eval?\"Model organism of evaluation awareness that acts differently when it's aware of being evaluated.Eval design: Making benchmarks less artificial and toyish:&nbsp; adding realistic context, avoiding stereotypical eval patterns.&nbsp;Some res...",

      "content": "In earlier posts, I wrote about the beingness axis and the cognition axis of understanding and aligning dynamic systems. Together, these two dimensions help describe what a system is and how it processes information, respectively.This post focuses on a third dimension: intelligence.&nbsp;Here, intelligence is not treated as a scalar (“more” or “less” intelligent), nor as a catalyst for consciousness, agency or sentience. Instead, like the other two axes, it is treated as a layered set of functional properties that describe how effectively a system can achieve goals across a range of environments, tasks, and constraints i.e. what kind of competence the system demonstrates.&nbsp;Intelligence is not a single scalar, but a layered set of competence regimes.Why a Separate Axis?When referring to intelligent dynamic systems, we are essentially talking about AI systems. And in casual conversations on AI, intelligence is often overloaded:Quite often the term intelligence is used inclusive of cognitive capabilities.With higher levels of intelligent task performance, the conversation around AI consciousness and sentience and agency seem to intensify, as if these are next levels of intelligence.&nbsp;Safety risks and threat potential seem to be perceived&nbsp;as escalating with improving levels of intelligence, as if intelligence is the sole vector for it.&nbsp;Where cognition describes information processing capabilities, intelligence describes how well cognition is leveraged towards tasks and goals. Separating intelligence from the other two core dimensions of beingness and cognition (specially cognition) can probably allow us to right-size the relative role of intelligence in AI Safety and Alignment.&nbsp;A Typology of AI System CompetencesAs for the other two axes, for convenience, I have grouped intelligence related capabilities &amp; behaviors into three broad bands, each composed of several layers as depicted in the image and described thereafter.&nbsp;Ontonic Intelligen...",

      "content": "Merry Christmas! Today I turn an earlier LW shortform into a full post and discuss \"unknown knowns\" \"obvious\" ideas that are actually hard to discuss because they're invisible when you don't have them, and then almost impossible to unsee when you do.Hopefully this is a fun article for like the twenty people who check LW on Christmas!__There are a number of implicit concepts I have in my head that seem so obvious that I don’t even bother verbalizing them. At least, until it’s brought to my attention other people don’t share these concepts.It didn’t feel like a big revelation at the time I learned the concept, just a formalization of something that’s extremely obvious. And yet other people don’t have those intuitions, so perhaps this is pretty non-obvious in reality.Here’s a short, non-exhaustive list:Intermediate Value TheoremNet Present ValueDifferentiable functions are locally linearGrice’s maximsTheory of MindIf you have not heard any of these ideas before, I highly recommend you read up on the relevant sections below! Most *likely*, they will seem obvious to you. You might already know those concepts by a different name, or they’re already integrated enough into your worldview without a definitive name.However, many people appear to lack some of these concepts, and it’s possible you’re one of them.As a test: for every idea in the above list, can you think of a nontrivial real example of a dispute where one or both parties in an intellectual disagreement likely failed to model this concept? If not, you might be missing something about each idea!Photo by Roberto Nickson on UnsplashThe Intermediate Value TheoremConcept: If a continuous function goes from value A to value B, it must pass through every value in between. In other words, tipping points must necessarily exist.This seems almost trivially easy, and yet people get tripped up often:Example 1: Sometimes people say “deciding to eat meat or not won’t affect how many animals die from factory farming, since groce...",

No: Colors, fonts, text sizing, text alignment, images, line spacing. Let's say I want to send someone a snippet from a blog post. If I paste this into my email client the font family, font size, blockquote styling, and link styling come along: If I do Cmd+Shift+V and paste without formatting, I get no styling at all: I can deal with losing the blockquote formatting, but losing the links is a pain. What I want is essentially the subset of HTML that can be represented in Markdown. So I automated this! I made a Mac command that pulls HTML from the clipboard, passes it through pandoc twice (HTML to Github-flavored markdown to HTML), and puts it back on the clipboard. I also packaged it up as a status-bar app: You can run it by clicking on the icon, or invoking the script: $ normalize-clipboard Which gives: Alternatively, if I actually want Markdown, perhaps to paste into an LLM interface, I can skip the conversion to HTML: $ markdownify-clipboard I'm pretty happy with this! It's open source, on github, so you're welcome to give it a try if it would be useful to you. Note that I haven't paid for an Apple Developer subscription, so if you want to use the pre-built binaries you'll need to click through scary warnings in both your browser and the OS. I've documented these in the README, though an advantage of building from source is that you don't have to deal with these.

      "content": "And Joseph came to the city of Bethlehem, looking for a room for him and Mary, to rest after their travels. But there was no room at the inn. No room with a friend, no room with family, and the inns were full. But one innkeeper did say that there was room in the manger.It would not seem a fitting place, a manger, packed in with the asses and what they leave. Not for the future King of Kings, who would later receive gifts of frankincense, myrrh, and gold. Not even for the child of a respected carpenter, an honorable middle-class profession. It was not much.But it was enough to keep a very pregnant woman warm. It was a roof over their heads, and hay that was softer than the ground in mid-winter, and easy access to water.It was much better than nothing. It was much better than saying that he could not help, and that he had no room at all. I hope that that innkeeper, if he became a Christian, felt proud. I hope he recognized that he offered something, even if it wasn’t much, and that was more than others had, and it was something that mattered. He may have regretted that he did not give more, but I hope he was proud that he gave what he had.There are three important things I take away from the story of the manger. The first is YIMBYism, obviously.The second is that it is good to offer what you can, even if it’s not much, just as you appreciate when people share the best of what they have with you. I don’t have a guest room for my friends and acquaintances, but I do have an air mattress that they’re always welcome to. If you can’t offer what you’d like to, you can still offer something. I think this is a particularly important point for people in their 20s, not able to live up to their parents’ standards for hosting. Let people crash on your couch. Offer to bring a tupperware meal to new parents you know. It’s good to help people in your community, even if you can’t do everything.
