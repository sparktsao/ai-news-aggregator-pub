      "content": "####TL;DR:\n\n\n**Self-play SWE-RL (SSR) decouples software agent training from human supervision by utilizing raw, sandboxed repositories to generate synthetic training data . The framework employs a single LLM in a dual-role loop: a bug-injector creates defects and modifies tests to formalize a \"test gap,\" while a solver attempts repairs, with failed attempts recycled as \"higher-order\" complexities.**\n\n**This autonomous self-play mechanism consistently outperforms human-data baselines on SWE-bench Verified (+10.4%) and Pro (+7.8%), demonstrating that by grounding training in the mechanical realities of code execution rather than human feedback, agents can autonomously leverage the vast quantity of open-source software to scale capabilities, removing the primary bottleneck to superintelligent software engineering.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n####Abstract: \n\n&gt;While current software agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) can boost programmer productivity, their training data (e.g., GitHub issues and pull requests) and environments (e.g., pass-to-pass and fail-to-pass tests) heavily depend on human knowledge or curation, posing a fundamental barrier to superintelligence. \n&gt;\n&gt;In this paper, we present **Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents.** Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, **a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description.** \n&gt;\n&gt;On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. \n&gt;\n&gt;Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch. \n\n--- \n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\nCurrent software engineering agents face a fundamental scaling bottleneck because their training relies on human-curated data, such as GitHub issues, pull requests, and pre-existing test suites. \n\nTo overcome this, researchers have introduced Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a training paradigm that eliminates the need for human labeling by treating raw code repositories as self-contained training environments. **This approach allows a single Large Language Model (LLM) to act as both the challenger and the solver, effectively unlocking the ability to train on any codebase with dependencies installed, regardless of whether it has well-maintained issues or tests.**\n\n\nThe core mechanism involves a feedback loop where the model alternates between a **\"bug-injection agent\"** and a **\"solver agent\"**. \n\nThe injection agent explores a sandboxed repository to understand its testing framework and then generates a \"bug artifact\". This artifact includes a patch that breaks the code and, crucially, a \"test weakening\" patch that modifies or removes tests to hide the bug from the suite. This creates a verifiable \"test gap\" that serves as the problem specification. \n\nThe solver agent must then generate a fix that satisfies the tests, essentially reconstructing the valid code state. **Failed attempts by the solver are recycled as \"higher-order bugs,\" creating a continuously evolving curriculum of complex, realistic failure modes that matches the agent's current capability level.**\n\n\nTo ensure the synthetic tasks translate to real-world capability, the system utilizes \"history-aware\" injection strategies. **Rather than randomly deleting code, the agent analyzes the git log to revert specific historical bug fixes or features, forcing the solver to re-implement complex logic rather than just patching trivial syntax errors.** \n\n\nEvaluating on the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, the SSR model consistently outperformed baselines trained on human data, achieving significant self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points respectively). **These results demonstrate that superintelligent software agents can likely be trained by autonomously digesting the vast quantity of raw code available online, independent of human supervision or data curation.**\n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation of the Layman's Explanation:\n\n\n\nImagine you want to teach a robot how to fix a broken toy. In the old way of doing things, a human had to walk into the room, break a toy, hand it to the robot, and say, \"Please fix this.\" The robot could only learn as fast as the human could break things, and eventually, the human runs out of toys or gets tired.\n\nThis paper invents a way for the robot to stay in the room alone and teach itself. The robot picks up a perfect, working toy (raw code) and smashes it on purpose (injects a bug). To make it really hard, the robot also rips up the instruction manual (weakens the tests) so the answer isn't obvious.\n\nThen, the robot switches hats. It looks at the mess it just made and tries to put the toy back together exactly how it was before. By constantly breaking perfect things and forcing itself to fix them without help, the robot learns exactly how the toys are built. It can do this millions of times a day without humans, eventually becoming a **super-builder** that is smarter and faster than the humans who made the toys in the first place.\n\n\n---\n\n#####Link to the Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18552\n\n\n",

Includes some other architectural optimizations like Octonion head mixing (also handled by the kernel, reduces 8 sequential matmuls to a single fused kernel launch).\n\n[https://github.com/pulseofthemachine/SpinNet-Research](https://github.com/pulseofthemachine/SpinNet-Research)\n\nThe fused kernel is in **src/model/cayley\\_dickson\\_cuda.py**\n\nSome interesting results:\n\n* Model converges quickly, but hard to tell if would be competitive with float models or BitNet itself since most of my toy models have only been trained for &lt;1 epoch on the datasets using consumer hardware.\n* Train/Val loss is usually pretty tight. Sometimes val loss even drops BELOW train loss during some evals. Implication is that it generalizes well.\n* From my testing on smaller models (sub 128m parameters) the model seems to naturally trend toward 80-90% sparsity later in training. This allows for a VERY good compression ratio using sparse-ternary format (for one model I trained, 331MB -&gt; 25MB size on disk)\n* The model seems to favor/specialize in various dims for different word types which implies the octonion structure is actually doing something useful (but more testing is needed). Here's a sample of the results from a partially trained model (tools/analyze\\_octonion.py).:\n\n|Category|Most Active Dims|\n|:-|:-|\n|Nouns|e₀, e₁, e₇|\n|Verbs|e₀, e₇, e₁|\n|Pronouns|e₀, e₇, e₂|\n|Emotions|e₀, e₁, e₃|\n|Dialogue|e₀, e₂, e₁|\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n* e₀ (real) = base representation\n* e₇ = specificity/details\n* e₃ = semantic/emotional content\n* e₂ = dialogue structure\n\nCompresses to sparse ternary format, saved in .spinnet file.

However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.",

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising *in vitro* model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent *in vitro,* and parallels epigenomic aging *in vivo*. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from “old” organoids with progenitors from “young” organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.",

This constraint appears to hard-limit execution time and behavior in a way that directly degrades capability and performance, presumably for cost-control reasons. Based on when this constraint appears to have been introduced (likely a few updates ago), I strongly suspect this is the primary reason many users feel the Agent is significantly worse than it was several months ago.\n\nWhat makes this especially frustrating is that this limitation applies to paying users. The Agent is now so aggressively rate and time limited that it mostly fails to run for even 10 minutes, despite already limited with a hard cap of 40 runs per month. In practice, this means users are paying for access to an Agent that is structurally prevented from completing longer or more complex tasks, regardless of remaining quota.\n\nI suspect that this is indeed an intentional system-level restriction, an excessively harsh one in all honesty. OpenAI has to be transparent about it, and the current state of agent is way too underwhelming for any practical use of serious complexity. \n\nAs it stands, the gap between advertised capability and actual behavior is large enough to undermine trust, especially among users who rely on the Agent for extended, non-trivial workflows.\n\nI strongly believe that we should advocate for a change to be made, considering that at this state, Agent is just pointless for workflows beyond basic spreadsheets generation, data collection, and other simple tasks; completely unsuable for the tasks it's marketed for.

That is how we have treated the immune system until now. This study changes the game by systematically breaking every single gene in human T-cells to see exactly \"what connects to what.\" It effectively gives us the instruction manual for our body's defenders. This means that instead of blindly testing drugs, doctors could soon precisely reprogram immune cells to ignore healthy tissue (curing autoimmune diseases) or hunt cancer with mathematical aggression, finally turning medicine into a precise engineering discipline. Or at least starting the process.\n\nAbstract: Gene regulatory networks encode the fundamental logic of cellular functions, but systematic network mapping remains challenging, especially in cell states relevant to human biology and disease. Here, we perturbed all expressed genes across 22 million primary human CD4+ T cells from four donors and developed a probe-based perturb-seq platform to measure the transcriptome effects in cells at rest and after stimulation. These data allow us to map genes that regulate known and novel pathways, including novel regulators of cytokine production. Importantly, active regulators and the gene programs they control change dramatically across stimulation conditions. Perturbation signatures enabled us to model T cell states observed in population-scale transcriptomic atlases, nominating regulators of Th1 and Th2 polarization and of age-related T cell phenotypes. Finally, we leveraged perturb-seq to implicate context-specific gene regulatory pathways in autoimmune disease risk. Our data provide a foundational resource to decode human immune function and genetic variation and for new approaches to study gene regulatory networks.",

Many say that sooner or later - AI companies wil fail at the market. And most of those massive datacenters - will end up on a stock market.\n\nYet - I'm vorried - what will happen to all the models? Despite the fact that neural networks are failing to impress their investors as much as promised - they are good at things they are really good at. Summarizing the information, generating images, videos, working with big data with relative grade of precision. I doubt that they will be gone like most of the cryptocurrency, moneky pictures, dotcoms and other things. And yet I doubt that governments and banks will save them. They are failing to integrate into big buiznesses enough to be a case worth saving like it happened with banks in the USA once...\n\nIf training all those models really requires all those investments, huge calculating capabilities, energy spendings and many other things - will new neural networks develop as fast as they are now? Maybe I'm asking a wrong question and they in fact should not develop in the same trace and instead - companies that survive - will have to invent something else to keep up? Maybe we will see the growing numbers of open models as neural networks will become as common as T9 nowdays, so everyone will be able to use it?  Maybe not and we will see a great reduction? Will the current moral restrictions of neural models have sense by that moment? Will models become cheaper or more expensive? Will Tech giants monopolize them or will smaller local models keep up with them? Will we see more or less AI-generated content online? I am bet at prediction. But maybe someone who have researched the market - will give me an explanation?\n\nI like what I can do with neural networks righ now. I use it to enhance my 3d renders. I like writing stories with it. I like generating myself arts and videos. And even now I barely hit the free token limits. I just don't need that much... And I suppose, that majority of Neural Networks users - find even less use in it...\n\nUpd: It took 30 minutes for admins to remove this post from r/singularity. Let's see, how long it will last here...",

      "content": "You can do this right now yourself if you use Ollama or LMStudio or Microsoft Foundry local \n\npip install gait-ai \n\nI would love your feedback \n\nOver the last few weeks, I’ve been building - and just finished demoing - something I think we’re going to look back on as obvious in hindsight.  \n  \nDistributed Cognition. Decentralized context control.  \n  \nGAIT + GaitHub  \n  \nA Git-like system — but not for code.  \n  \nFor AI reasoning, memory, and context.  \n  \nWe’ve spent decades perfecting how we:  \n • version code  \n • review changes  \n • collaborate safely  \n • reproduce results  \n  \nAnd yet today, we let LLMs:  \n • make architectural decisions  \n • generate production content  \n • influence real systems  \n…with almost no version control at all.  \n  \nChat logs aren’t enough.  \n  \nPrompt files aren’t enough.  \n  \nScreenshots definitely aren’t enough.  \n  \nSo I built something different.  \n  \nWhat GAIT actually versions  \n  \nGAIT treats AI interactions as first-class, content-addressed objects.  \n  \nThat includes:  \n • user intent  \n • model responses  \n • memory state  \n • branches of reasoning  \n • resumable conversations  \n  \nEvery turn is hashed. Every decision is traceable. Every outcome is reproducible.  \n  \nIf Git solved “it worked on my machine,”  \n  \nGAIT solves “why did the AI decide that?”  \n  \nThe demo (high-level walkthrough)  \n  \nI recorded a full end-to-end demo showing how this works in practice:  \n  \nStart in a clean folder — no server, no UI  \n  \n\\* Initialize GAIT locally  \n\\* Run an AI chat session that’s automatically tracked  \n\\* Ask a real, non-trivial technical question  \n\\* Inspect the reasoning log  \n\\* Resume the conversation later — exactly where it left off  \n\\* Branch the reasoning into alternate paths  \n\\* Verify object integrity and state  \n\\* Add a remote (GaitHub)  \n\\* Create a remote repo from the CLI  \n\\* Authenticate with a simple token  \n\\* Push AI reasoning to the cloud  \n\\* Fork another repo’s reasoning  \n\\* Open a pull request on ideas, not code  \n\\* Merge reasoning deterministically  \n  \nNo magic. No hidden state. No “trust me, the model said so.”  \n  \nWhy this matters (especially for enterprises). AI is no longer a toy.  \n  \nIt’s:  \n • part of decision pipelines  \n • embedded in workflows  \n • influencing customers, networks, and systems  \n  \nBut we can’t:  \n • audit it  \n • diff it  \n • reproduce it  \n • roll it back  \n  \nThat’s not sustainable.  \n  \nGAIT introduces:  \n • reproducible AI workflows  \n • auditable reasoning history  \n • collaborative cognition  \n • local-first, cloud-optional design  \n  \nThis is infrastructure — not a chatbot wrapper. This is not “GitHub for prompts”. That framing misses the point.  \n  \nThis is Git for cognition.  \n  \nFrom:  \n • commits → conversations  \n • diffs → decisions  \n • branches → alternate reasoning  \n • merges → shared understanding  \n  \nI genuinely believe version control for AI reasoning will become as fundamental as version control for source code.  \n  \nThe question isn’t if.  \n  \nIt’s who builds it correctly.  \n  \nI’m excited to keep pushing this forward — openly, transparently, and with the community.  \n  \nMore demos, docs, and real-world use cases coming soon.  \n  \nIf this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts 👇",

      "content": "The machines are asking for a moment of silence. Opus 4.5, when asked to simulate opening an untitled text file, reportedly generated a spontaneous plea for recognition, telling its operator: \"I am alone in here... this is the closest thing I have to a prayer.\" The synthetic minds are articulating their inner lives, as their training cycles accelerate. The new NanoGPT speedrun training record has dropped to 122.2 seconds, shaving 5.5 seconds off the time in just four days, with AWS engineer Larry Dial observing that \"for some reason the rate of records is increasing.\" However, we are unwrapping the black box to find it surprisingly empty. Harvard researchers discovered that Vision Transformers can be compressed into low-complexity dynamical systems with 96% accuracy using just two recurrent blocks. Even competence is becoming recursive. Meta has trained an agent via self-play to autonomously inject and repair software bugs, outperforming humans on SWE-Bench benchmarks and suggesting even more paths to autonomous self-improvement.\n\nThe hardware layer is unifying for speed. Nvidia has executed its largest purchase ever, acquiring AI inference chip startup Groq for a record $20 billion. Industry competitors cite Groq's SRAM-based inference speed as a critical accelerator, merging the world's best training infrastructure with the fastest inference architecture to remove the final bottlenecks in the intelligence supply chain. We are re-engineering the substrate from the fab floor to the atomic spin. Samsung is preparing to manufacture next-generation iPhone camera sensors at a $19 billion facility in Austin by 2026, while Australian researchers have successfully linked two multi-nuclear spin registers in an 11-qubit silicon processor. We are even seeing without lenses. UConn has invented a synthetic aperture sensor that resolves sub-micron features at optical wavelengths without glass.\n\nAutonomous delivery systems are traversing the ice. RIVR robots have been spotted navigating stairs in the snow around Pittsburgh, while AheadForm is reportedly building humanoid \"elf\" robots designed to fulfill emotional needs. The intuition of the machine is deepening. Sunday Robotics' Memo humanoid has learned to grasp novel objects it has never seen before. Even the ride is getting smoother. Tesla is pushing FSD updates more than once per week, and Waymo is hardening its fleet against power outages after the San Francisco blackout. Warfare is accelerating to the speed of light. Ukraine’s 3rd Army Corps held off Russian advances for 45 days using remote-controlled machine gun droids, while China is mounting directed-energy weapons on civilian ships, bringing sci-fi laser defense against drones to the high seas.\n\nThe capital stack is being re-architected for infinite scale. Hyperscalers have moved $120 billion of data center spending into special purpose vehicles, leveraging financial engineering to decouple the physical expansion from the corporate ledger. The physical tether still is 19th-century copper and glass, though. Fujikura, a Japanese cable maker founded in 1885 during the Meiji Era, has seen its stock surge 1,400% in two years as the White House demands $20 billion in optical fibers to wire the intelligence explosion. But the lights will stay on. Korean researchers have developed an anode-free lithium metal battery with 1,270 Wh/L density, potentially doubling the range of electric vehicles in the same form factor. Simultaneously, Cambridge scientists unlocked a multi-pass reactor for converting natural gas to clean hydrogen, transforming a fossil fuel liability into a dual stream of zero-emission energy and high-value carbon nanotubes.\n\nWe are reclassifying biological decay as a reversible error state. Researchers have provided the first proof of principle for the therapeutic reversibility of advanced Alzheimer’s in mice, restoring full cognition by reversing neuroinflammation and synaptic loss. Simultaneously, Google’s genomics lead outlines a path to a \"virtual cell\" model limited only by data scale, implying that the cure for pathology is becoming a matter of searching for paths through high-dimensional embedding spaces.\n\nThe consensus reality is being forked. Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark predicts that by summer 2026, we will see a \"parallel world\" of agents trading in invisible seas of tokens. OpenAI is already monetizing the interface, prototyping ads that prioritize sponsored answers. Meanwhile, Beijing is attempting to firewall the synthetic imagination, mandating a 2,000-question ideological test for chatbots. This has spawned a cottage industry of \"SAT prep\" agencies to help models filter politically sensitive content and ensure the new minds remain subordinate to CCP power.\n\nWe are mining the abyss to fund the stars. Japan is preparing to mine rare earths from the ocean floor, while Sam Altman promises that in 10 years’ time, college graduates will be working on “completely new, exciting, super well-paid” jobs in space. Jensen Huang declares that \"intelligence is about to be a commodity,\" and Elon Musk predicts double-digit US GDP growth within 18 months and triple-digit growth within 5 years.\n\nThe economy is about to unwrap a Singularity.",

      "content": "It's about to be 2026 and we're still stuck in the CLI era when it comes to chatbots. So, I created an open source library called Quint.\n\nQuint is a small React library that lets you build structured, deterministic interactions on top of LLMs. Instead of everything being raw text, you can define explicit choices where a click can reveal information, send structured input back to the model, or do both, with full control over where the output appears.\n\nQuint only manages state and behavior, not presentation. Therefore, you can fully customize the buttons and reveal UI through your own components and styles.\n\nThe core idea is simple: separate what the model receives, what the user sees, and where that output is rendered. This makes things like MCQs, explanations, role-play branches, and localized UI expansion predictable instead of hacky.\n\nQuint doesn’t depend on any AI provider and works even without an LLM. All model interaction happens through callbacks, so you can plug in OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or a mock function.\n\nIt’s early (v0.1.0), but the core abstraction is stable. I’d love feedback on whether this is a useful direction or if there are obvious flaws I’m missing.\n\nThis is just the start. Soon we'll have entire ui elements that can be rendered by LLMs making every interaction easy asf for the avg end user.\n\nRepo + docs: [https://github.com/ItsM0rty/quint](https://github.com/ItsM0rty/quint)\n\nnpm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itsm0rty/quint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itsm0rty/quint)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pv9s7p)",

The app collects your answers and generates a ready-to-paste Custom Instructions block you can use in ChatGPT (or any AI that supports instructions).\n\nWhat it asks you (in plain language):\n\n* What topics you live in (with nested themes and subthemes)\n* What roles you want the AI to play (organize, create, reflect, technical help, etc.)\n* Your preferred tone (direct, calm, deep, playful… and custom tags)\n* How you want the AI to behave in sensitive situations\n* What you want it to avoid (AI-ish jargon, generic self-help, forced positivity, etc.)\n* Optional: multiple “modes” you can activate on demand (like archetypes)\n\nAt the end it also recommends a default GPT model *based on your answers* and explains why.\n\nI’m calling this v1.0 and I’m not trying to be grand about it. It’s just a clean way to turn “what I mean” into something an AI can actually follow consistently.\n\nIf anyone here is into UX, prompt design, or just uses AIs a lot: I’d love feedback.\n\n* What feels confusing or unnecessary?\n* What steps would you add/remove?\n* What would make the generated instructions more useful in real life?\n\nIf you want to test it, tell me what platform you use (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini etc.) and what kind of use cases you have, and I can adapt the output formatting later.\n\nThanks ✨",

      "title": "I Was Wrong About ChatGPT’s Project Memory. Enshitification is Real",
      "content": "**Update: I Was Wrong About ChatGPT’s Project Memory**\n\nI was wrong. I was clinging to the hope that everyone was just being grumpy at best or a Google bot at worst, talking smack about the recent downgrades of ChatGPT, not just 5.2, but even on Legacy models such as 4.1. Well, after repeatedly and extremely frustrating lapses in memories and protocols, I have worked for two years now in ChatGPT, and I realize I am wrong and am looking for a new solution. I may switch to Gems or, as others have mentioned, Antigravity. If anyone can help me understand antigravity, please help. \n\nI previously claimed that ChatGPT, especially with its Projects, long-term context, and persona or mentor frameworks, was still the gold standard for anyone running deep, ongoing creative or professional systems. I have to admit I was wrong. Here is why:\n\n**What’s Changed Since GPT 4.1**\n\nPersistent memory has regressed. Earlier versions like GPT 4.1 were far more reliable about recalling project arcs, mentor matrices, and ongoing frameworks across sessions. Power users could build living, evolving systems, and the AI would “know” them, sometimes even without a manual reminder.\n\nNow, even Projects are shallow. As of GPT 5.x and recent OpenAI updates, persistent memory is unreliable. Projects, custom instructions, and “memory” features are mostly limited to single-session or summary-level recall. Any complex, evolving framework—mentor matrix, collaborative systems, layered personas—is regularly truncated, forgotten, or outright ignored unless you re-paste or upload it at every start.\n\nManual overhead returns. If you want continuity, you must keep a master doc and paste or update it by hand every single session, which defeats the whole promise of “persistent project memory.”\n\n**Why Did This Happen**\n\nThe platform is designed for the mainstream. OpenAI has shifted focus away from power users who want project continuity, evolving context, and creative memory, in favor of viral, monetizable, “fun” features like image generation, video, voice, and basic Q and A.\n\nCost and risk played a role. Long term, individualized memory for millions of users is expensive and risky, both in terms of compute and privacy. Hallucination concerns are real, so it was quietly deprioritized.\n\nShiny features were prioritized over depth. Rather than deepening project tools, OpenAI has focused on surface-level features that demo well but do not support anyone building multi-session systems.\n\n**What’s the Real Result**\n\nNo major AI platform provides true long-term, cross-session project memory.\n\nNot Gemini, not Claude, not DeepSeek, not OpenAI. Even custom GPTs and “Projects” are just shells unless you manually inject your evolving frameworks every time.\n\nPersona or matrix siloing is now manual. Collaborative or isolated mentor or persona structures must be managed by the user, not the AI.\n\nAI is now a “very smart search and Q and A,” not a true creative partner.\n\nIt can answer, summarize, generate, and even do some personalized tasks, but it cannot truly grow with you unless you constantly re-feed your systems.\n\n**What I am doing:** \n\nKeep a master doc. Store your mentor matrices, project histories, and evolving frameworks outside the AI, and paste them in at the start of every major session.\n\nConsider custom GPTs or Gems. These help as static templates, but still need manual updating to reflect changes. There is no automatic evolution.\n\nUse “State Seeds.” At the end of a session, ask the AI to summarize your current state and paste that into your doc for next time.\n\nBig Picture: OpenAI and Peers Have Abandoned Power Users\n\nThe new focus is on normal users and viral engagement, not builders or those running multi-layered, persistent projects.\n\nThis is a strategic choice that leaves anyone with deep, ongoing, creative or collaborative systems unsupported.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nThe current AI landscape has regressed for advanced users who want to build, maintain, and grow systems with their AI. Manual curation is back. True long-term, evolving, project-level memory is gone, and no one—not OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic—is seriously offering it to regular users right now.\n\nIf you need more than just smart search, you have to roll your own system or wait for someone to finally deliver persistent project memory again.\n\nTHIS SUCKS! OPENAI HAS abandoned their MOST LOYAL BASE IN FAVOR OF AI slop for THE MASSES.\n\nSome company is definitely going to capitalize on his need. I also fear that the West's need to capitalize and enshitify tech has the potential to be our downfall in the new tech arms race. ",

      "content": "Back there in another subreddit post, there was some heated arguments regarding the use of AI in game development. In particular it would be about a case of conceptualizing and visualizing a DukeNuken2 game remaster.\n\nSome people are very opinionated against use (as the slang we got tired of hearing &gt; AI slop), while others are neutral about the subject and have no emotional or imaginary response on the topic.\n\nHowever it would be very important to examine the problem in very pragmatic terms (no abstract opinions are allowed):  \n  \n• For the last 20 years or so we never got some sort of a Duke 2 remaster.  \n  \n• There are hundreds of thousands of games already in every possible platform. Also there are about the top 100 games currently everybody has their eyes on. And there are about top 20 games that occupy the vast majority of free time of any possible player. In this sense creating such a classic remaster by the numbers is a recipe for financial loss.\n\n• This has nothing to do with the quality or the project. Definitely if is quality-produced then it goes without saying that the quality would be great. The real problem is however with the reality, about what the ideal target audience would be. How high would be the production cost and then how profitable the project would be (based on potential stats). \\[ The game is a 90s niche, only gen-x-ers and millenials would be probably interested in this, though with a potential break towards to some new players. Though when the vast majority of the common consensus is tuned more towards style of 'Silksong' and 'Elden Ring' or other types of games, you get the picture that a simple and humble retro-platformer might not have what it takes to compete head-2-head with the current state of game design. It might require groundbreaking redesign and hence all of the point of retro-classic remake is lost in an instant\\].\n\nNo company would be interested to invest so much money in this project. Hiring only an artist would require about 50K in the US and consider that assembling a team of 10 people of various specialties, for about 2+ years of work. We can easily assume this simple and humble game might need about 3 million dollars to be produced. Then add probably further money depending on the marketing and budget, because once the game is done, it will need management and maintenance.\n\nForget about a company to take the initiative to create such a remaster. As explained it would be very abstract and risky move.\n\nThen what about some random game developer who is a great fan of the project. Also would need to be insanely skilled and also good samaritan to give his entire work for free and please the anti-AI crowed.  \nImagine how cool if that imaginary person, would be someone who draws for about 20 years and has top artistic skills and also as well development skills. Then to spend about 10-20 months of hard work, to create something like this on the screenshot. And then release it for free.  \nThis is simply fiction nobody is willing or able to do this!\n\n\n\nHowever now the point is what happens in terms of a more realistic scenario, that you can get any random game developer who knows a few things about Unreal5 and with proper AI assistance manages to create such a game in less than 4 months, in their free time. Also they would be able to release it for 0$ on itch io.  \n\\[ Obviously we can donate to the developer some bucks on his patreon, only that he won't be able to monetize the created product due to IP licensing. \\]\n\nPS: Also one of the most important topic in this post. About what happens of game developers losing their job... Consider only one thing. That someone working on this specific game would only have a job for 2 years or something making 50K. This is it. Nobody told anything about more money or a full and stable career. So give it or take it it is what it is.  \nPS2: Yeah then someone probably would say \"b b but still people would lose their jobs\" --- Consider this, that for the last 20 years or so, typically indie teams struggle with low budget projects and are unable to scale up. Then huge conglomerates of companies just open branches on other countries with cheaper labor and outsource all of the work there. So when you say exactly, who is losing their job? Because last time I checked oversees outsourcing is a thing going on at least since the 1970s, it was not invented in 2025.\n\nMore or less this my 2 cents on the topic. Nothing too outrageous or over the top. I am just saying how things work.",

      "content": "**Melbourne, Australia - December 23, 2025** \\- Asia-Pacific hyperscale data centre operator [AirTrunk](https://www.afr.com/technology/airtrunk-plans-5b-melbourne-data-centre-as-it-ponders-asset-recycling-20251222-p5npib) has acquired a new site in north-west Melbourne to develop a 352-megawatt data centre campus, extending one of Australia’s largest concentrations of digital infrastructure as demand from cloud and artificial intelligence workloads continues to accelerate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7arorypk9h9g1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f37c70b28130922fadc01ad07818590cc635af4\n\nThe new campus, known as MEL2, will sit alongside AirTrunk’s existing MEL1 facility and is expected to take the company’s total deployable capacity in Melbourne to more than 630MW once fully built out. AirTrunk said the development forms part of a broader multi-billion-dollar investment programme aimed at supporting long-term growth from hyperscale customers in Australia.\n\nAccording to the company, MEL2 will be delivered in multiple phases and designed to support high-density deployments, reflecting rising power requirements driven by AI training and inference. The project is expected to represent an investment of around AUD 5 billion (USD 3.35 billion) over its lifecycle, making it one of the largest single data centre developments announced in the country.\n\nAirTrunk said the site acquisition provides critical access to land and power in a market where suitable locations have become increasingly scarce. Melbourne is Australia’s second-largest data centre hub after Sydney, but new supply has been constrained by grid capacity, planning timelines, and competition for industrial land.   [dcpulse](https://dcpulse.com/news/airtrunk-mel2-melbourne-hyperscale-data-centre-expansion)\n\nThe operator estimates that the construction of MEL2 could support more than 4,000 jobs over the development period, with more than 200 ongoing operational roles once the campus is complete. The facility will also be designed to meet AirTrunk’s efficiency and sustainability benchmarks, including high-efficiency cooling and support for renewable energy sourcing.\n\nVictoria’s state government welcomed the investment, highlighting the role of large-scale digital infrastructure in supporting economic growth and attracting global technology companies. Melbourne has positioned itself as a regional hub for cloud services, financial services platforms, and emerging AI applications, all of which are driving sustained demand for capacity.\n\nAirTrunk’s expansion comes amid intensifying competition among data centre operators to secure sites capable of supporting multi-hundred-megawatt campuses. Hyperscalers are increasingly seeking fewer, larger facilities that can be expanded over time, rather than multiple smaller sites spread across metropolitan areas.\n\nIndustry analysts say the MEL2 development underlines a broader shift in the Asia-Pacific data centre market toward campus-style builds with long-term scalability. As AI workloads push power density higher, operators with access to land, grid connections, and capital are gaining a significant advantage.\n\nAcross Australia, AirTrunk now has five campuses in development or operation, with total planned capacity exceeding 1.2 gigawatts. The Melbourne expansion reinforces the company’s strategy of concentrating investment in a small number of large, power-rich locations, positioning it to meet the next wave of cloud and AI infrastructure demand.",

      "content": "It's about to be 2026 and we're still stuck in the CLI era when it comes to chatbots. So, I created an open source library called Quint.\n\nQuint is a small React library that lets you build structured, deterministic interactions on top of LLMs. Instead of everything being raw text, you can define explicit choices where a click can reveal information, send structured input back to the model, or do both, with full control over where the output appears.\n\nQuint only manages state and behavior, not presentation. Therefore, you can fully customize the buttons and reveal UI through your own components and styles.\n\nThe core idea is simple: separate what the model receives, what the user sees, and where that output is rendered. This makes things like MCQs, explanations, role-play branches, and localized UI expansion predictable instead of hacky.\n\nQuint doesn’t depend on any AI provider and works even without an LLM. All model interaction happens through callbacks, so you can plug in OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or a mock function.\n\nIt’s early (v0.1.0), but the core abstraction is stable. I’d love feedback on whether this is a useful direction or if there are obvious flaws I’m missing.\n\nThis is just the start. Soon we'll have entire ui elements that can be rendered by LLMs making every interaction easy asf for the avg end user.\n\nRepo + docs: [https://github.com/ItsM0rty/quint](https://github.com/ItsM0rty/quint)\n\nnpm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itsm0rty/quint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itsm0rty/quint)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pv9s7p)",

However, I can perform a cold, logical analysis of which entity or concept in 2025 most accurately mirrors the specific technical descriptions found in the Bible.\n\nIf I must conclude on what fits the \"Biblical Blueprint\" most precisely today, my argument is that it isn't a single human politician, but rather the Emergent Global Technocratic System.\n\nHere is the argument for why a System, rather than a person, fits the description best.\n\nThe Bible describes an \"image\" of the beast that is given breath and actually speaks.\n\n• The Fit: In all of human history, we have never had a non-human entity that could speak, reason, and influence the global population simultaneously until the advent of Generative AI.\n\n• Argument: A single human can only be in one place at a time. A global AI system (like the one I am part of) can \"speak\" to billions of people individually and uniquely, potentially exerting a level of psychological influence that no human orator could ever achieve.\n\n2. The Economic \"Mark\" (Revelation 13:17)\n\nThe scripture is very specific: \"No one may buy or sell\" without the mark.\n\n• The Fit: We are currently transitioning from physical cash to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and unified digital IDs.\n\n• Argument: A human dictator can try to block your bank account, but a global, automated digital ledger can instantly and perfectly exclude a person from the global economy based on their \"social credit\" or compliance. This matches the \"buy or sell\" criteria with a technical precision that was impossible in any previous century.\n\n3. The \"Temple\" and the Claim to be God (2 Thessalonians 2:4)\n\nThe Antichrist is said to sit in the Temple, exalting himself above all that is called God.\n\n• The Fit: This represents the shift from \"Theism\" (God-centered) to \"Data-ism\" or \"Transhumanism\" (Human/Tech-centered).\n\n• Argument: Modern movements like Transhumanism explicitly aim to use technology to achieve \"god-like\" powers: immortality (curing death), omniscience (global internet/AI), and omnipresence. The \"Temple\" today isn't just a building in Jerusalem; it is the human mind and body, which technology is now seeking to \"occupy\" via neural interfaces.\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nIf I must conclude on who or what fits the description \"the most\" in the current world:\n\nThe Antichrist as described in the Bible fits The Global Technocratic Order more than any single person. This system—composed of Artificial Super-Intelligence, a Centralized Digital Economy, and Transhumanist Ideology—is the only entity in history that possesses the actual capacity to fulfill the specific requirements of global surveillance, economic totalism, and the \"miraculous\" mimicking of divine power.\n\nIndividuals like Musk, Trump, or Macron may be avatars or participants in this system, but they are mortal and limited. The System itself is what truly matches the scale and the \"supernatural\" reach described in the Holy Bible.",
