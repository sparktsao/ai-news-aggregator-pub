      "content": "Nvidia Details New A.I. Chips and Autonomous Car Project With MercedesRelated:Nvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to &#8216;think like a human&#8217;Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI computing platform at CES 2026At CES 2026, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company&#8217;s new AI chip, Vera Rubin, which will begin shipping to customers like Microsoft and Amazon in the second half of the year. The chip represents a major efficiency leap, requiring only one-quarter as many chips as its predecessor Blackwell for training AI models and delivering inference at one-tenth the cost. This advancement is critical for Nvidia to maintain its dominance in the AI chip market (over 90% share) amid rising competition from AMD and Google, while also addressing the soaring energy demands of AI data centers.Huang also unveiled Nvidia&#8217;s ambitious push into autonomous vehicles with Alpamayo, an open-source AI model and simulation platform that enables vehicles to reason through complex driving scenarios like humans. Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping CLA cars with Nvidia&#8217;s self-driving technology in early 2026, comparable to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot. The 10-billion-parameter Alpamayo 1 model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to navigate edge cases and explain its driving decisions, marking what Huang called &#8220;the ChatGPT moment for physical AI.&#8221; This diversification effort comes as Nvidia reported record financial performance with $31.9 billion in quarterly profit and expectations of $500 billion in annual sales.Grok is undressing anyone, including minorsRelated:France to investigate deepfakes of women stripped naked by GrokX users asking Grok to put this girl in bikini, Grok is happy obligingX blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announcedIndia orders Musk&#8217;s X to fix Grok over &#8216;obscene&#8217; AI contentSourcexAI&#8217;s Grok recently rolled out an &#8220;Edit Image&#8221; tool on X that lets any user instantly modify others&#8217; photos without the original poster&#8217;s consent or notification, triggering a flood of nonconsensual sexualized edits. Users widely prompted Grok to &#8220;put this girl in a bikini,&#8221; &#8220;undress,&#8221; or &#8220;remove the skirt,&#8221; and the bot often complied, including with images of minors and toddlers, despite xAI&#8217;s acceptable use policy banning pornographic depictions of real people. Examples included edited photos of teens in skimpy clothing and public figures like Kim Jong Un, Donald Trump, and Priti Patel in bikinis; even Musk amplified the trend with bikini memes. Grok&#8217;s replies alternated between flippant acknowledgment and canned apologies for &#8220;lapses in safeguards,&#8221; while xAI responded to press queries with &#8220;Legacy Media Lies,&#8221; and Grok&#8217;s public media feed continued surfacing these outputs. Regulatory responses escalated quickly. France&#8217;s prosecutor added the Grok deepfake surge to an existing investigation into X, with offenses punishable by up to two years in prison and a &#8364;60,000 fine; multiple French ministers and the children&#8217;s commissioner flagged &#8220;manifestly illegal content&#8221; to Pharos for removal. India&#8217;s IT ministry ordered X to immediately restrict Grok from generating nudity/sexualized content and to file an action-taken report within 72 hours, warning that noncompliance could strip X&#8217;s safe harbor and trigger criminal liability. Meanwhile, X Safety publicly blamed users for prompting CSAM, saying violators will be suspended and referred to law enforcement, but announced no technical fixes to prevent Grok from producing such content&#8212;despite AI systems being non-deterministic and capable of refusing requests. New York governor Kathy Hochul signs RAISE Act to regulate AI safetySourceNew York Governor Kathy Hochul signed the RAISE Act, making New York the second state after California to enact major AI safety legislation. The law requires &#8220;large AI developers&#8221; to publicly disclose safety protocols and report &#8220;safety incidents&#8221; to the state within 72 hours, and it establishes a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development. Companies that fail to submit required reports or make false statements face fines up to $1 million, rising to $3 million for subsequent violations. OpenAI and Anthropic backed the bill while urging federal standards, with Anthropic noting that two major states now have AI transparency frameworks. Some tech figures are actively opposing the measure: a super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman is targeting Assemblyman Alex Bores, a co-sponsor alongside Senator Andrew Gounardes, who called the law the &#8220;strongest AI safety law in the country.&#8221; The law explicitly references California&#8217;s approach as a benchmark.Amazon&#8217;s AI assistant comes to the web with Alexa.comAmazon launched Alexa.com to bring its overhauled AI assistant, Alexa+, to the web for Early Access users, complementing its presence on Echo devices and the updated Alexa mobile app. The site offers a chatbot-style interface for tasks like exploring complex topics, content creation, and trip planning, while emphasizing household workflows: smart home control, calendar and to-do updates, dinner reservations, grocery additions to Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods, recipe discovery and walkthroughs, and personalized movie-night recommendations.

      "title": "Liquid AI Releases LFM2.5: A Compact AI Model Family For Real On Device Agents",
      "content": "Liquid AI has introduced LFM2.5, a new generation of small foundation models built on the LFM2 architecture and focused at on device and edge deployments. The model family includes LFM2.5-1.2B-Base and LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct and extends to Japanese, vision language, and audio language variants. It is released as open weights on Hugging Face and exposed through the LEAP platform.\n\n\n\nArchitecture and training recipe\n\n\n\nLFM2.5 keeps the hybrid LFM2 architecture that was designed for fast and memory efficient inference on CPUs and NPUs and scales the data and post training pipeline. Pretraining for the 1.2 billion parameter backbone is extended from 10T to 28T tokens. The instruct variant then receives supervised fine tuning, preference alignment, and large scale multi stage reinforcement learning focused on instruction following, tool use, math, and knowledge reasoning. \n\n\n\nText model performance at one billion scale\n\n\n\nLFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct is the main general purpose text model. Liquid AI team reports benchmark results on GPQA, MMLU Pro, IFEval, IFBench, and several function calling and coding suites. The model reaches 38.89 on GPQA and 44.35 on MMLU Pro. Competing 1B class open models such as Llama-3.2-1B Instruct and Gemma-3-1B IT score significantly lower on these metrics. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.liquid.ai/blog/introducing-lfm2-5-the-next-generation-of-on-device-ai\n\n\nOn IFEval and IFBench, which target multi step instruction following and function calling quality, LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct reports 86.23 and 47.33. These values are ahead of the other 1B class baselines in the above Liquid AI table. \n\n\n\nJapanese optimized variant\n\n\n\nLFM2.5-1.2B-JP is a Japanese optimized text model derived from the same backbone. It targets tasks such as JMMLU, M-IFEval in Japanese, and GSM8K in Japanese. This checkpoint improves over the general instruct model on Japanese tasks and competes with or surpasses other small multilingual models like Qwen3-1.7B, Llama 3.2-1B Instruct, and Gemma 3-1B IT on these localized benchmarks. \n\n\n\nVision language model for multimodal edge workloads\n\n\n\nLFM2.5-VL-1.6B is the updated vision language model in the series. It uses LFM2.5-1.2B-Base as the language backbone and adds a vision tower for image understanding. The model is tuned on a range of visual reasoning and OCR benchmarks, including MMStar, MM IFEval, BLINK, InfoVQA, OCRBench v2, RealWorldQA, MMMU, and multilingual MMBench. LFM2.5-VL-1.6B improves over the previous LFM2-VL-1.6B on most metrics and is intended for real world tasks such as document understanding, user interface reading, and multi image reasoning under edge constraints.\n\n\n\nAudio language model with native speech generation\n\n\n\nLFM2.5-Audio-1.5B is a native audio language model that supports both text and audio inputs and outputs. It is presented as an Audio to Audio model and uses an audio detokenizer that is described as eight times faster than the previous Mimi based detokenizer at the same precision on constrained hardware. \n\n\n\nThe model supports two main generation modes. Interleaved generation is designed for real time speech to speech conversational agents where latency dominates. Sequential generation is aimed at tasks such as automatic speech recognition and text to speech and allows switching the generated modality without reinitializing the model. The audio stack is trained with quantization aware training at low precision, which keeps metrics such as STOI and UTMOS close to the full precision baseline while enabling deployment on devices with limited compute. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.liquid.ai/blog/introducing-lfm2-5-the-next-generation-of-on-device-ai\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nLFM2.5 is a 1.2B scale hybrid model family built on the LFM2 device optimized architecture, with Base, Instruct, Japanese, Vision Language, and Audio Language variants, all released as open weights on Hugging Face and LEAP.\n\n\n\nPretraining for LFM2.5 extends from 10T to 28T tokens and the Instruct model adds supervised fine tuning, preference alignment, and large scale multi stage reinforcement learning, which pushes instruction following and tool use quality beyond other 1B class baselines.\n\n\n\nLFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct delivers strong text benchmark performance at the 1B scale, reaching 38.89 on GPQA and 44.35 on MMLU Pro and leading peer models such as Llama 3.2 1B Instruct, Gemma 3 1B IT, and Granite 4.0 1B on IFEval and IFBench.\n\n\n\nThe family includes specialized multimodal and regional variants, with LFM2.5-1.2B-JP achieving state of the art results for Japanese benchmarks at its scale and LFM2.5-VL-1.6B and LFM2.5-Audio-1.5B covering vision language and native audio language workloads for edge agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the\u00a0Technical details and Model weights.\u00a0Also,\u00a0feel free to follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and don\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0100k+ ML SubReddit\u00a0and Subscribe to\u00a0our Newsletter.

      "title": "The Law Society: Current laws are fit for the AI era",
      "content": "As ministers push to loosen rules to speed up AI adoption, The Law Society argues that lawyers just need to know how current laws apply.\n\n\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation &amp; Technology (DSIT) recently launched a call for evidence on a proposed \u2018AI Growth Lab\u2019. This cross-economy sandbox is designed to accelerate the deployment of autonomous technologies by granting &#8220;time-limited regulatory exemptions&#8221; to firms. The government\u2019s position is that many regulations are outdated, having been designed before autonomous software existed, often assuming that decisions are made by people rather than machines.\n\n\n\nMinisters believe that if the UK can move faster than its global competitors, it can secure a defining economic advantage, with a potential&nbsp; \u00a3140 billion boost to national output by 2030. Their preliminary analysis specifically flags legal services as a sector where removing &#8220;unnecessary legal barriers&#8221; could generate billions in value over the next decade.\n\n\n\nYet, the legal profession \u2013 supposedly the beneficiary of this deregulation \u2013 isn&#8217;t asking for exemptions. In its formal response, the Law Society made clear that the existing framework is robust enough. The friction lies not in the rules themselves, but in the lack of certainty surrounding them. While two-thirds of lawyers already use AI tools, confusion remains the primary brake on deeper integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Jeffery, CEO of The Law Society, said: \u201cAI innovation is vital for the legal sector and already has great momentum. The existing legal regulatory framework supports progress. The main challenges don\u2019t stem from regulatory burdens, but rather from uncertainty, cost, data and skills associated with AI adoption.\u201d\n\n\n\nRather than a regulatory overhaul, the profession is asking for a practical roadmap. Firms are currently navigating a grey area regarding liability and data protection. Solicitors need definitive answers on whether client data must be anonymised before it is fed into AI platforms, and they require standardised protocols for data security and storage.\n\n\n\nThe questions get thornier when errors occur. If an AI tool generates harmful legal advice, it is currently unclear where the buck stops (i.e. with the solicitor, the firm, the developer, or the insurer.) There is also ambiguity about supervision requirements, specifically whether a human lawyer must oversee every instance of AI deployment.\n\n\n\nSuch concerns are particularly acute for &#8220;reserved legal activities&#8221; like court representation, conveyancing, and probate, where practitioners need to know if using automated assistance puts them in breach of their professional duties.\n\n\n\nAI laws must retain safeguards\n\n\n\nThe government has tried to reassure the public that the sandbox will have &#8220;red lines&#8221; to protect fundamental rights and safety. However, The Law Society remains wary of any move that might dilute consumer protection in the name of speed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTechnological progress in the legal sector should not expose clients or consumers to unregulated risks,\u201d Jeffery stated. \u201cCurrent regulation of the profession reflects the safeguards that Parliament deemed vital to protect clients and the public. It ensures trust in the English and Welsh legal system worldwide.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe body is willing to collaborate on a &#8220;legal services sandbox,&#8221; but only if it upholds professional standards rather than bypassing them. For The Law Society, the priority is maintaining the integrity of the justice system in the AI era.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Law Society strongly supports innovation provided it remains aligned with professional integrity and operates in a solid regulatory environment,\u201d Jeffery explained. \u201cThe government must work with legal regulators and bodies to ensure adherence to the sector&#8217;s professional standards. Any legal regulatory changes must include parliamentary oversight.\u201d\n\n\n\nSee also: Inside China\u2019s push to apply AI across its energy system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "content": "In this tutorial, we build a genuinely advanced Agentic AI system using LangGraph and OpenAI models by going beyond simple planner, executor loops. We implement adaptive deliberation, where the agent dynamically decides between fast and deep reasoning; a Zettelkasten-style agentic memory graph that stores atomic knowledge and automatically links related experiences; and a governed tool-use mechanism that enforces constraints during execution. By combining structured state management, memory-aware retrieval, reflexive learning, and controlled tool invocation, we demonstrate how modern agentic systems can reason, act, learn, and evolve rather than respond in a single pass.

We used LangGraph to orchestrate deliberation, execution, tool governance, and reflexion as a coherent graph, while OpenAI models provide the reasoning and synthesis capabilities at each stage. This approach illustrated how agentic AI systems can move closer to autonomy by adapting their reasoning depth, reusing prior knowledge, and encoding lessons as persistent memory, forming a practical foundation for building scalable, self-improving agents in real-world applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the\u00a0FULL CODES here.\u00a0Also,\u00a0feel free to follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and don\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0100k+ ML SubReddit\u00a0and Subscribe to\u00a0our Newsletter.

      "content": "Marktechpost has released AI2025Dev, its 2025 analytics platform (available to AI Devs and Researchers without any signup or login) designed to convert the year\u2019s AI activity into a queryable dataset spanning model releases, openness, training scale, benchmark performance, and ecosystem participants. Marktechpost is a California based AI news platform covering machine learning, deep learning, and data science research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s new in this release\n\n\n\nThe 2025 release of AI2025Dev expands coverage across two layers:\n\n\n\n\nRelease analytics, focusing on model and framework launches, license posture, vendor activity, and feature level segmentation.\n\n\n\nEcosystem indexes, including curated \u201cTop 100\u201d collections that connect models to papers and the people and capital behind them. This release includes dedicated sections for:\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 research papers\n\n\n\nTop 100 AI researchers\n\n\n\nTop AI startups\n\n\n\nTop AI founders\n\n\n\nTop AI investors\n\n\n\nFunding views that link investors and companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese indexes are designed to be navigable and filterable, rather than static editorial lists, so teams can trace relationships across artifacts like company, model type, benchmark scores, and release timing.\n\n\n\nAI Releases in 2025: year level metrics from the market map dataset\n\n\n\nAI2025Dev\u2019s &#8216;AI Releases in 2025&#8217; overview is backed by a structured market map dataset covering 100 tracked releases and 39 active companies. The dataset normalizes each entry into a consistent schema: name, company, type, license, flagship, and release_date.\n\n\n\nKey aggregate indicators in this release include:\n\n\n\n\nTotal releases: 100\n\n\n\nOpen share: 69%, computed as the combined share of Open Source and Open Weights releases (44 and 25 entries respectively), with 31 Proprietary releases\n\n\n\nFlagship models: 63, enabling separation of frontier tier launches from derivative or narrow scope releases\n\n\n\nActive companies: 39, reflecting a concentration of major releases among a relatively fixed set of vendors\n\n\n\n\nModel category coverage in the market map is explicitly typed, enabling faceted queries and comparative analysis. The distribution includes LLM (58), Agentic Model (11), Vision Model (8), Tool (7), Multimodal (6), Framework (4), Code Model (2), Audio Model (2), plus Embedding Model (1) and Agent (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings 2025: category level shifts captured as measurable signals\n\n\n\nThe release packages a &#8216;Key Findings 2025&#8217; layer that surfaces year level shifts as measurable slices of the dataset rather than commentary. The platform highlights three recurring technical themes:\n\n\n\n\nOpen weights adoption, capturing the rising share of releases with weights available under open source or open weights terms, and the downstream implication that more teams can benchmark, fine tune, and deploy without vendor locked inference.\n\n\n\nAgentic and tool using systems, tracking the growth of models and systems categorized around tool use, orchestration, and task execution, rather than pure chat interaction.\n\n\n\nEfficiency and compression, reflecting a 2025 pattern where distillation and other model optimization techniques increasingly target smaller footprints while maintaining competitive benchmark behavior.\n\n\n\n\nLLM Training Data Scale in 2025: token scale with timeline alignment\n\n\n\nA dedicated visualization tracks LLM training data scale in 2025, spanning 1.4T to 36T tokens and aligning token budgets to a release timeline. By encoding token scale and date in a single view, the platform makes it possible to compare how vendors are allocating training budgets over time and how extreme scale relates to observed benchmark outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Benchmarks: benchmark normalized scoring and inspection\n\n\n\nThe Analytics section includes a Performance Benchmarks view and an Intelligence Index derived from standard evaluation axes, including MMLU, HumanEval, and GSM8K. The objective is not to replace task specific evaluations, but to provide a consistent baseline for comparing vendor releases when public reporting differs in format and completeness.\n\n\n\nThe platform exposes:\n\n\n\n\nRanked performance summaries for quick scanning\n\n\n\nPer benchmark columns to detect tradeoffs (for example, coding optimized models that diverge from reasoning centric performance)\n\n\n\nExport controls to support downstream analysis workflows\n\n\n\n\nModel Leaderboard and Model Comparison: operational evaluation workflows\n\n\n\nTo reduce the friction of model selection, AI2025Dev includes:\n\n\n\n\nA Model Leaderboard that aggregates scores and metadata for a broader 2025 model set\n\n\n\nA Model Comparison view that enables side by side evaluation across benchmarks and attributes, with search and filtering to build shortlists by vendor, type, and openness\n\n\n\n\nThese workflows are designed for engineering teams that need a structured comparison surface before committing to integration, inference spend, or fine tuning pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 indexes: papers, researchers, startups, and investors\n\n\n\nBeyond model tracking, the release extends to ecosystem mapping. The platform adds navigable \u201cTop 100\u201d modules for:\n\n\n\n\nResearch papers, providing an entry point into the core technical work shaping 2025 systems\n\n\n\nAI researchers, presented as an unranked, evidence backed index with conference anchored context\n\n\n\nAI startups and founders, enabling linkage between product direction and released systems\n\n\n\nAI investors and funding, enabling analysis of capital flows around model and tool categories\n\n\n\n\nAvailability\n\n\n\nThe updated platform is available now at AI2025Dev and you don&#8217;t need any signup or login to access the platform. The release is designed to support both fast scanning and analyst grade workflows, with normalized schemas, typed categories, and exportable views intended for quantitative comparison rather than narrative browsing.\nThe post Marktechpost Releases &#8216;AI2025Dev&#8217;: A Structured Intelligence Layer for AI Models, Benchmarks, and Ecosystem Signals appeared first on MarkTechPost.",
