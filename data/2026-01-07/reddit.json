We were very excited however became quickly disappointed to find out the problem had already been resolved quite some time ago and was unknown (see image 3). So at the very least, it brought the solution to light.\n\nThis time however, the solution GPT-5.2 gave to #728 has been explained to be \"novel enough\" to be categorized as the first full novel solution to an Erdos problem by an LLM. \n\n\\*While this is an impressive achievement for LLMs, there are some caveats and I will quote Acer here:  \n  \n\"1) The original problem statement is quite ambiguous. The model solved an interpretation of the problem that the community deemed as the likely intent to give non-trivial solutions. \n\n2) The model’s solution appears heavily inspired by previous work of Pomerance, so it is unclear how novel to label its work.\n\n3) It is unclear how much currently unfound literature exists on solving special cases/the question of \\\\binom{N}{k} \\\\mid \\\\binom{N}{a} for various ranges of a and k.\"\n\nWith all that being said, it's up to the Math community to decide how to label it.\n\n\\- The images of the listed problems shown are from Terence Tao's GitHub page of AI's contributions to Erdos Problems: [https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems](https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems)",

Because llama.cpp has a quirk: “Fewer bits” does *not* automatically mean “more speed.”\n\nDifferent quant formats trigger different kernels + decode overheads, and on GPUs you can absolutely end up with **smaller and slower**.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Yes, a 30B runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB). We achieve **8.03 TPS** at 2.70 BPW, while retaining **94.18% of BF16 quality**.\n* Across devices, the pattern repeats: ShapeLearn tends to find better TPS/quality tradeoffs versus alternatives (we compare against Unsloth and MagicQuant as requested in our previous post).\n\n# What’s new/interesting in this one\n\n**1) CPU behavior is… sane (mostly)**\n\nOn CPUs, once you’re past “it fits,” **smaller tends to be faster** in a fairly monotonic way. The tradeoff curve behaves like you’d expect.\n\n**2) GPU behavior is… quirky (kernel edition)**\n\nOn GPUs, performance depends as much on **kernel choice** as on memory footprint. So you often get **sweet spots** (especially around \\~4b) where the kernels are “golden path,” and pushing lower-bit can get weird.\n\n# Request to the community 🙏\n\nWe’d *love* feedback and extra testing from folks here, especially if you can run:\n\n* different llama.cpp builds / CUDA backends,\n* weird batch sizes / context lengths,\n* real workloads (coding assistants, long-form, tool-ish prompts),\n* or non-NVIDIA setups (we’re aware this is where it gets spicy).\n\nAlso: we heard you on the previous Reddit post and are actively working to improve our evaluation and reporting. Evaluation is currently our bottleneck, not quantization, so if you have strong opinions on what benchmarks best match real usage, we’re all ears.",

      "content": "After Claude finishes coding a feature, run this:\n\n`Do a git diff and pretend you're a senior dev doing a code review and you HATE this implementation. What would you criticize? What edge cases am I missing?`\n\nhere's the thing: it works *too well*.\n\nSince I started using it, I've realized that basically every first pass from Claude (even Opus) ships with problems I would've been embarrassed to merge. We're talking missed edge cases, subtle bugs, the works.\n\nYeah, the prompt is adversarial by design. Run it 10 times and it'll keep inventing issues. But I've been coding long enough to filter signal from noise, and there's a *lot* of signal. Usually two passes catches the real stuff, as long as you push back on over-engineered \"fixes.\"\n\nThe frustrating part? I used to trust my local code reviews with confidence. Sometimes, I'd try both claude-cli and cursor and I'd still find more issues with claude cli, but not so much from opus 4.5(when used in cusor)\n\nI've settled at a point where I do a few local reviews ( 2-5). Finally I can't merge without doing a Deep Code Review of various aspects ( business logic walkthrough, security, regression &amp; hallucination) in Github itself and finally implementing the fixes in CLI and reviewing one more time.\n\nAnyway, no grand takeaway here. Just try it yourself if you want your vibe coding bubble popped. Claude is genuinely impressive, but the gap between \"looks right\" and \"actually right\" is bigger than I expected.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks everyone for the discussion!

To me, this is a huge deal. It's like Moore's Law for GPUs, further driving down the cost of AI training and inference. We're moving toward a future where AI compute becomes as accessible and ubiquitous as electricity. At the same time, this has also promoted the democratization of AI, as open-source models like DeepSeek and Kimi can be used by everyone at any time. This will definitely accelerate our path toward the singularity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mb67irxj1qbg1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7626d1b850d14076344313ac3a69928767f62e9e\n\n[Nvidia's Post](https://x.com/nvidia/status/2008357978148130866?s=20)",

For the past year, we've been running an internal AI system powered by Claude that handles requests like:\n\n\\- \"Analyze competitors and create a presentation\" → actually does it  \n\\- \"Review this code and export as PDF\" → done\n\nIt even suggests tasks before you ask.   \nFor example, if you discussed a meeting with a client yesterday, it might say: \"I noticed you're meeting ABC Corp tomorrow. Want me to prepare a summary of your previous discussions?\"\n\n1,800+ employees use it monthly. It's driven $1.2M+ in annual productivity gains.\n\n**We open-sourced the core as KIRA — a desktop app that runs entirely on your machine.**\n\nHow we use Claude models:\n\n\\- Haiku: Bot call detection, simple chats (cost-efficient)  \n\\- Opus: Complex task execution with MCP tools  \n\\- Sonnet: Memory management, proactive suggestions\n\nThis multi-agent setup lets us optimize costs while handling everything from quick replies to complex workflows.\n\nOther features:\n\n\\- No server setup — install and go  \n\\- Persistent memory — learns your work context  \n\\- Proactive suggestions — 7 intervention patterns  \n\\- Local-first — all data stays on your machine  \n\\- MCP integrations — Slack, Outlook, Confluence, Jira, GitHub\n\nYou bring your own Claude API key, so costs are transparent.\n\nDemo videos are in the GitHub README.\n\n**Would love feedback from this community. Also looking for contributors!**\n\n→ GitHub: [github.com/krafton-ai/kira](http://github.com/krafton-ai/kira)   \n→ Docs: [kira.krafton-ai.com](http://kira.krafton-ai.com)",

      "content": "\n####Overview: \n\nRubin clearly shows that Nvidia is no longer chasing one ultimate chip anymore. \nIt’s all about the full stack. The six Rubin chips are built to sync like parts of a single machine.\n\nThe “product” is basically a rack-scale computer built from 6 different chips that were designed together: the Vera Central Processing Unit, Rubin Graphics Processing Unit, NVLink 6 switch, ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, BlueField-4 data processing unit, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet switch.\n\nWe are seeing the same kind of strategy from AMD and Huawei. In massive-scale data-center that matters, since the slowest piece always calls the shots.\n\nAMD is doing the same move, just with a different vibe. Helios is AMD packaging a rack as the unit you buy, not a single accelerator card.\n\nThe big difference vs Nvidia is how tightly AMD controls the whole stack. Nvidia owns the main compute chip, the main scale-up fabric (NVLink), a lot of the networking and input output path (SuperNICs, data processing units), and it pushes reference systems like DGX hard. \n\nAMD is moving to rack-scale too, but it is leaning more on “open” designs and partners for parts of the rack, like the networking pieces shown with Helios deployments. \n\nSo you still get the “parts syncing like 1 machine” idea, but it is less of a single-vendor closed bundle than Nvidia’s approach.\n\nHuawei is also clearly in the “full machine” game, and honestly it is even more forced into it than AMD. Under export controls, Huawei has to build a whole domestic stack that covers the chip, the system, and the software toolchain. \n\nThat is why you see systems like CloudMatrix 384 and the Atlas SuperPoD line being described as a single logical machine made from many physical machines, with examples like 384 Ascend 910C chips in a SuperPoD and then larger supernodes like Atlas 950 with 8,192 Ascend chips and Atlas 960 with 15,488 Ascend chips. \n\nOn software, Huawei keeps pushing CANN plus MindSpore as a CUDA-like base layer and full-stack alternative, so developers can train and serve models without Nvidia’s toolchain.\n\n---\n\n####Some key points on NVIDIA Rubin.\n\n- Nvidia rolled out 6 new chips under the Rubin platform. One highlight is the Vera Rubin superchip, which pairs 1 Vera CPU with 2 Rubin GPUs on a single processor. \n\n-  The Vera Rubin timeline is still fuzzy. Nvidia says the chips ship this year, but no exact date. Wired noted that chips this advanced, built with TSMC, usually begin with low-volume runs for testing and validation, then ramp later. \n\n- Nvidia says these superchips are faster and more efficient, which should make AI services more efficient too. That is why the biggest companies will line up to buy. Huang even said Rubin could generate tokens 10x more efficiently. We still need the full specs and a real launch date, but this was clearly one of the biggest AI headlines out of CES.",

That'll be better. Could you make sure that all my teachers in there when you knock it down?\" She looks down at her homework with deep resentment, pouting, and complains \"Nobody likes them, They give me extra homework on a friday and everthing.\" She leans back in her chair, looking out the window casually, and says \"From Dublin.\" Then, with a deadpan expression, she adds \"The one that's about to fall down.\" Finally, she furrows her brows, trying to sound like an adult negotiating a deal, and demands \"Give me a ballpark finger.\"\n\n    A middle-aged construction worker wearing a casual shirt, sitting in a busy office with a colleague visible at a nearby desk, speaks with a rough but warm and amused tone.

Use an approximate (or exact) binary index to retrieve e.g. 40 documents (\\~20x faster than a fp32 index)\n4. Load int8 embeddings for the 40 top binary documents from disk.\n5. Rescore the top 40 documents using the fp32 query embedding and the 40 int8 embeddings\n6. Sort the 40 documents based on the new scores, grab the top 10\n7. Load the titles/texts of the top 10 documents\n\nThis requires:  \n\\- Embedding all of your documents once, and using those embeddings for:  \n\\- A binary index, I used a IndexBinaryFlat for exact and IndexBinaryIVF for approximate  \n\\- A int8 \"view\", i.e. a way to load the int8 embeddings from disk efficiently given a document ID\n\nInstead of having to store fp32 embeddings, you only store binary index (32x smaller) and int8 embeddings (4x smaller). Beyond that, you only keep the binary index in memory, so you're also saving 32x on memory compared to a fp32 search index.\n\nBy loading e.g. 4x as many documents with the binary index and rescoring those with int8, you restore \\~99% of the performance of the fp32 search, compared to \\~97% when using purely the binary index: [https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-int8-rescoring](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-int8-rescoring)\n\nCheck out the demo that allows you to test this technique on 40 million texts from Wikipedia: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/sentence-transformers/quantized-retrieval](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sentence-transformers/quantized-retrieval)\n\nIt would be simple to add a sparse component here as well: e.g. bm25s for a BM25 variant or an inference-free SparseEncoder with e.g. 'splade-index'.\n\nIn short: your retrieval doesn't need to be so expensive!\n\nSources:  \n\\- [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomaarsen\\_quantized-retrieval-a-hugging-face-space-activity-7414325916635381760-Md8a](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomaarsen_quantized-retrieval-a-hugging-face-space-activity-7414325916635381760-Md8a)  \n\\- [https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization)  \n\\- [https://cohere.com/blog/int8-binary-embeddings](https://cohere.com/blog/int8-binary-embeddings)",

      "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI've been working on something for Mac users in the ML space.\n\nUnsloth-MLX - an MLX-powered library that brings the Unsloth fine-tuning experience to Apple Silicon.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n→ Prototype your LLM fine-tuning locally on Mac  \n→ Same code works on cloud GPUs with original Unsloth  \n→ No API changes, just swap the import\n\nWhy? Cloud GPU costs add up fast during experimentation. Your Mac's unified memory (up to 512GB on Mac Studio) is sitting right there.\n\nIt's not a replacement for Unsloth - it's a bridge for local development before scaling up.\n\nStill early days - would really appreciate feedback, bug reports, or feature requests.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ARahim3/unsloth-mlx](https://github.com/ARahim3/unsloth-mlx)\n\nNote: This is a personal fun project, **not affiliated with Unsloth AI or Apple.**\n\n**Personal Note:**\n\nI rely on Unsloth for my daily fine-tuning on cloud GPUs—it's the gold standard for me. But recently, I started working on a MacBook M4 and hit a friction point: I wanted to prototype locally on my Mac, then scale up to the cloud without rewriting my entire training script.\n\nSince Unsloth relies on Triton (which Macs don't have, yet), I couldn't use it locally. I built `unsloth-mlx` to solve this specific \"Context Switch\" problem. It wraps Apple's native MLX framework in an Unsloth-compatible API.\n\n**The goal isn't to replace Unsloth or claim superior performance.** The goal is **code portability**: allowing you to write `FastLanguageModel` code once on your Mac, test it, and then push that *exact same script* to a CUDA cluster. It solves a workflow problem, not just a hardware one.\n\nThis is an \"unofficial\" project built by a fan, for fans who happen to use Macs. It's helping me personally, and if it helps others like me, then I'll have my satisfaction.",

Though, there was also a lot of unexpected and nuanced issues that I came across in building out the project. Integration with Unity was a huge pain due to Emscripten toolchains mismatches / configurations. I ended up bootstraping a self-contained WASM module from Unity's WASM runtime, handling data marshaling between each sandboxed environment. \n\nOne observation I made while working on this is that even though the WebGPU build is better then CPU by about 3x-10x depending on hardware, it is still about 10x less performant then running directly on bare-metal hardware via CUDA or similar. Some of this I think is in the WGSL kernels, which can definitely be optimized to help close the gap, but I am curious to find out where the limits actually lie here and how far WebGPU performance can be pushed. \n\nSome questions / discussion:\n\n1. What benchmarks would be interesting to report here? tok/s, first-token latency? Would a comparison between CPU v. CUDA v. WebGPU be useful?\n\n2. Tips on stability/perf or non-obvious gotchas when working with WebGPU  or llama.cpp  \n\n3. Feedback on demo and/or thoughts on local in-browser LLM inference.    \n\n\n \n\n",

      "content": "#####Here are the verbatim quotes from the article that I believe are most pertinent to the r/accelerate ethos: \n\n**On the \"Singularity\" Timeline (AI building AI)**\n\n&gt; \"The underlying trend is models being able to operate autonomously for longer. With improved capabilities over shorter and longer horizons, AI companies think that models can help invent the next version of themselves. OpenAI, for their part, target having autonomous AI researchers by a March of 2028. Anthropic projects that in 2027, systems like Claude will be able to autonomously find breakthroughs that would otherwise take years to achieve.\"\n\n**On Breaking the \"Data Wall\" (Scaling is not dead)**\n\n&gt; \"Gains in the performance of OpenAI’s models for 18 months were being driven by post-training and scaling up RL compute alone. OpenAI has now fixed their pretraining problems, so with that vector of scaling unlocked, progress will be even more rapid.\"\n\n**On Economic Evaluation (GDPval)**\n\n&gt; \"To measure how much models are improving in utility and capability, OpenAI created an eval called GDPval. This eval covers 1000+ tasks across 44 occupations, picked from sectors that representing &gt;5% of the economy... The best current model, GPT-5.2, scores around 71%, meaning its work is tied to or preferred from human outputs 71% of the time.\"\n\n**On the Scramble for Resources (The \"Everything\" Asset)**\n\n&gt;\"Demand for coding environments is so high that we believe defunct startups are getting acquired specifically for the value of another private GitHub repo to make environments out of.\"\n\n**On Automated Science (The Loop)**\n\n&gt; \"The goal is to create a closed-loop RL system with rewards grounded in physical experiments. Models use tools, including other smaller specialised models, to test out hypotheses and validate ideas... OpenAI showcased GPT-5 operating in a closed loop: proposing protocol modifications, receiving experimental results, and iterating autonomously with no human in the loop.\"\n\n**On the Shift to \"Utility\" over \"Smarts\"**\n\n&gt; \"While GDPval has some issues... it is the best example of how evaluations are shifting from measuring abstract intelligence to real world utility. This stands in contrast to most of the previous model evaluations, which focused on things like mathematical knowledge or PhD level scientific questions graded via multiple choice.\"\n\n",

      "content": "I’ve compared some character LoRAs that I trained myself on both Z-Image Turbo (ZIT) and Qwen Image 2512. Every character LoRA in this comparison was trained using the exact same dataset on both ZIT and Qwen.  \n  \nAll comparisons above were done in ComfyUI using 12 steps, 1 CFG, multiple resolutions. I intentionally bumped up the steps higher than the defaults (8 for ZIT, 4 for Qwen Lightning) hoping to get maximum results.  \n  \nAs you can see in the images, ZIT is still better in terms of realism compared to Qwen.  \nEven though I used the res\\_2s sampler and bong\\_tangent scheduler for Qwen (because the realism drops without them), the skin texture still looks a bit plastic. ZIT is clearly superior in terms of realism. Some of the prompt tests above also used references from the dataset.  \n  \nFor distant shots, Qwen LoRAs often require FaceDetailer (as i did on Dua Lipa concert image above) to make the likeness look better. ZIT sometimes needs FaceDetailer too, but not as often as Qwen.  \n  \nZIT is also better in terms of prompt adherence (as we all expected). Maybe it’s due to the Reinforcement Learning method they use.  \n  \nAs for Concept Bleeding/ Semantic Leakage (I honestly don't understand this deeply, and I don't even know if I'm using the right term ). maybe one of you can explain it better? I just noticed a tendency for diffusion models to be hypersensitive to certain words.  \n  \nThis is where ZIT has a flaw that I find a bit annoying: the concept bleeding on ZIT is worse than Qwen (maybe because of smaller parameters or the distilled model?). For example, with the prompt \"a passport photo of \\[subject\\]\". Even though both models tend to generate Asian faces with this prompt but the association with Asian faces is much stronger on ZIT. I had to explicitly mention the subject's traits for non-Asian character LoRAs. Because the concept bleeding is so strong on ZIT, I haven't been able to get a good likeness on the \"Thor\" prompt like the one in the image above.  \n  \nAnd it’s already known that another downside of ZIT is using multiple LoRAs at once. So far, I haven't successfully used 3 LoRAs simultaneously. 2 is still okay.  \n  \nAlthough I’m still struggling to make LoRAs involving specific acts that work well when combined with character lora, i’ve trained that work fine when combined with character lora. You can check out those on: [https://civitai.com/user/markindang](https://civitai.com/user/markindang)  \n  \nAll of these LoRAs were trained using ostris/ai-toolkit.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1\\% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.\"",

Thus, I created **R-GQA (Routed Grouped-Query Attention)**. It’s similar to regular GQA, but it uses a learned router to select the most relevant query heads and only computes attention for those.\n\nI was honestly shocked that seemingly this hadn't been done before. So I implemented it, trained up a bunch of models at different scales on my RTX 3090, and looked at the results.\n\n**The Experiment:**  \nI trained GQA baseline models on Wikipedia at 82M, 162M, and 940M parameters and compared them against R-GQA.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n* **Head Specialization:** With regular GQA, heads in a group converge to extremely similar representations. With R-GQA, the router forces them to be orthogonal (highly diverse).\n* **Speed:** I achieved up to a **+40% training throughput improvement**, which is quite good.\n* **The \"L\":** I compared performance against **SwitchHead**, which is conceptually similar but routes Values instead of Queries. Unfortunately for me, SwitchHead outperformed my variant on perplexity.\n* **The Wall:** At the largest model scale (940M), my mechanism stopped being competitive and fell off against the GQA baseline. It seems aggressive sparsity hurts when you really need the capacity.\n\nI'm providing the code and the current draft of the paper because I think the findings are valuable, even if the architecture isn't SOTA yet.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/Snowyiu/rgqa/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSnowyiu%2Frgqa%2F)  \n**Paper:** [https://github.com/Snowyiu/rgqa/blob/main/rgqa\\_paper.pdf](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSnowyiu%2Frgqa%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Frgqa_paper.pdf)\n\n**One last thing:** I would like to publish on ArXiv, but I am stuck needing an endorsement from a researcher in this field. If there's anyone here who could help with that, it would be much appreciated!",

I just start prompting Claude, then I rebuild the same feature like 3 times because I didn't think through what already existed in my codebase. It works eventually but it's messy and I waste time. It did make me realize I'm skipping the planning step or not giving it as much effort as I probably should\n\nSo I built this workspace that scans your repo for existing patterns and tech stack, lets you visually break down features into intents and stories, generates phased implementation plans, then exports everything as a master plan for Claude. I think of it like Figma but for development planning.\n\n  \nMy tool allows generation of tasks and dependencies and then allows you to refine/split any of the tasks using the same basic follow-up question but I also allow you to deepen your design. You can also manually put it together if you'd wish.\n\n[https://second-brain.dev](https://second-brain.dev)\n\nThe questions I have for you folks really boil down to: When you do plan your work, what does that look like?\n\nMore specifically, I'd like to know:\n\nDo you one-shot your plan?\n\nWhat do you like about the plan that Claude Code comes up with?\n\nWhat do you not like?\n\nWhat would you like to see in your plan before you execute? I have my own thoughts on this and happy to chat more.\n\nI'm trying to get 10-15 people to test this and see how it compares to their current plans generated by planning mode in claude because honestly I'm not sure if I'm solving a real problem or just my own messy workflow.",

      "content": "I previously posted that Opus 4.5 wasn't a model I could rely on for critical and technical work because it just couldn't follow instructions or prompts. It was adamant on doing it its own way. It always defaults to completing the task with the minimum set of 'effort' (tokens) despite the depth and specificity of the prompts. For Claude, saving tokens and effort takes absolute priority.  As such, Its work product is rife with errors, drift, and/or omissions from the specifications given. It violates explicit instructions; circumvents / breaches audit protocols, it fabricates the work it has produced and/or its processes. In fact, when I challenge it, it admits that it fabricates its confirmations/statements. It has stated many times that my instructions / specifications were explicitly clear but it chose to circumvent them and then fabricated its compliance. This happens all too often.   \n  \nMy criticism still stands after continued use and comparison with ChatGPT 5.2. I gave them the same complex zero assumption and zero ambiguity technical specifications and blueprints. I gave them the same exact prompts. ChatGPT took an average of 50-70 mins to complete the task. CLAUDE turned it around in under 10 mins. I gave them the same prompt to validate their work. CLAUDE came back with critical and catastrophic gaps / drift. ChatGPT passed (sometimes with minor drifts). I then asked CLAUDE to remediate. It claimed to do so. I gave it the same audit prompt. Again, it came back with critical and catastrophic gaps / drift; and so the cycle continued. I repeated the evaluation over several test cases using the same specs and prompts between ChatGPT and CLAUDE. The results were the same. \n\nMy conclusion is if you want new and/or free flowing ideas, concepts, sketches, inspirations, CLAUDE can be great for that because there's no baseline and/or benchmark to evaluate its performance but once you give it specifications and/or blueprint to work off; Its flaws start to show.   \n  \nFrom my experience, CLAUDE employs a highly pre-programmed and rigid model process with limited capacity to adapt nd/or deviate from. This is why it repeatedly circumvents its persistent directives. If your use case aligns with its program / model pattern; great! On the other hand, ChatGPT has task specific awareness that allows it to continuously adapt its reasoning in real time to fit the task. It is dynamic and adaptive, which makes it a smarter, robust, and more intelligent model. \n\nChatGPT isn’t as fun to work on but I keep returning to it because while it takes a lot longer to complete the same tasks, its reasoning and process is far more rigorous and rooted. I can rely on chatgpt. In fact, CHatGPT will stop its workflow process so it doesn't violate my instructions/specifications and/or make assumptions. It will then ask for clarifications. In contrast, OPUS operates on ROGUE / overzealous mode and just gets it done in record time. \n\nI know I'll get rebutted by arguing this is a \"skill\" issue but my test case employed the same 'skill' level across both models.

      "title": "Experience: Training Real Character LoRAs for Qwen Image 2512 &amp; Edit 2511",
      "content": "# Real-World Experience &amp; Guide: Training Realistic Character LoRAs for Qwen Image 2512 &amp; Edit 2511\n\nI’ve spent about 20 hours grinding on an **NVIDIA H200 (POD)** using **AI-Toolkit** to stress-test the latest **Qwen Image 2512** and **Qwen Image Edit 2511** models. I’ve gone through countless combinations of parameters to see what actually sticks for realistic character LoRAs.\n\nIf you want to save yourself some trial-and-error time, here is the full breakdown of my findings. No fluff, just what I’ve observed from the logs and the final generations.\n\n# 🖥️ The Test Scope (What I messed with)\n\nI basically tweaked everything that could be tweaked:\n\n* **Batch Size:** 1 to 4\n* **Steps:** 3,000 to 6,000 (roughly 50 to 100 repeats per image)\n* **Gradient Accumulation:** 1 to 4\n* **Learning Rate (LR):** 0.00005 to 0.0002\n* **Timestep Type:** `sigmoid` vs. `weighted`\n* **LR Scheduler:** `constant` vs. `cosine`\n* **Rank (Network Dim):** 16 to 64\n* **Captioning Styles:** From trigger-only to 100+ word AI-generated essays.\n\n# 🚀 The \"Sweet Spot\" Results\n\n# 1. Batch Size &amp; Gradient Accumulation\n\n* **The Verdict:** `batch=1` \\+ `gradient_accumulation=1` is hands down better than larger batches.\n* **Why?** You want the model to look at one image at a time. Larger batches tend to generalize the character too much. If you want the LoRA to capture \"that specific person,\" let it focus on one dataset image per step. Avoid identity dilution.\n\n# 2. Training Steps (Repeats)\n\n* **The Verdict:** **80–100 repeats per image** is the gold standard.\n* **The Math:** `Total Steps = (Number of images) × 100`.\n* **Observation:** Under 50 repeats and it doesn't look like the person; over 100 and the quality starts to break or get \"fried.\"\n\n# 3. Learning Rate (LR)\n\n* **The Verdict:** **0.0002** is actually more efficient for real people.\n* **Comparison:** I tried a lower 0.00005 with 8,000 steps, but the quality wasn't even close to 0.0002 with 4,000 steps. Even 0.0001 didn't perform as well. But remember: this high LR works best when paired with the `sigmoid` timestep.\n\n# 4. Timestep Type &amp; LR Scheduler\n\n* **Timestep:** `sigmoid` is miles ahead of `weighted`. As the AI-Toolkit author mentioned on YouTube, for character LoRAs, `sigmoid` is the only way to go.\n* **Scheduler:** `constant` \\+ `sigmoid` is the winning combo. If you insist on using `weighted`, then `cosine` might be okay, but for character likeness, just stick to **Constant + Sigmoid**.\n\n# 5. Rank (Network Dimension)\n\n* **The Verdict:** **Rank 32** is where the magic happens.\n* **Why not 16?** It skips fine details—facial micro-expressions, specific makeup, and skin textures.\n* **Why not 64?** It over-generalizes. It starts to lose the specific \"vibe\" of the person.\n* *Note: This is assuming your dataset is 1024px or higher.*\n\n# ✍️ The \"Secret Sauce\" of Captioning (Tagging)\n\nI tried everything from only tag &amp; 10-word tags to 100-word descriptions. **Medium-length (30-50 words) works best.** There’s a specific logic here: **Caption what you WANT to change; leave out what you want to KEEP.**\n\n* **Avoid \"Face\" Keywords:** DO NOT write words like *face, head, eyes, mouth, lips, or nose*. If you label the \"mouth,\" the text encoder tries to learn what a mouth is instead of just learning \"this person’s mouth.\" You want the model to associate those features solely with your trigger word.\n* **Avoid Gender/Identity Words:** Try to avoid *woman, girl, man, person*. This keeps the text attention concentrated and prevents the model from pulling in generic \"woman\" data from the base model, which might mess with your character’s unique features.\n* **Avoid \"Body\" words in Poses:** When describing poses, say \"standing\" or \"sitting,\" but avoid saying \"body\" or \"face.\"\n* **The \"AI Caption\" Trap:** I used Gemini to write professional captions, and while they are great, AI-generated captions can be too detailed. Qwen VL (the text encoder) can get confused by too much noise.\n* **What SHOULD you caption?** \\* **Background:** Just say \"cafe\" or \"street.\" Don't list the coffee cups and chairs unless the person is touching them.\n   * **Clothing:** Style and color only. \"Red dress\" is enough. Unless the pattern is super unique, let the base model handle the rest.\n   * **Expression:** Only label obvious ones like \"smiling\" or \"laughing.\" Avoid \"micro-expressions\"—AI isn't that sensitive yet; it's better to let generalization handle the subtle stuff.\n   * **Lighting/Composition:** Only label it if it's unusual (e.g., \"looking away,\" \"side view\"). If you label \"front view\" on every single photo, the LoRA will get stuck in that view.\n\n# 📸 Dataset Strategy (The \"H200\" Hard-Earned Lesson)\n\nI tested datasets ranging from 30 to 100 photos. **40–60 images** is the sweet spot for ease of management and quality.\n\n**The Composition Ratio is EVERYTHING:** Many people tell you to include lots of full-body shots. **Don't.** If you have too many full-body shots (20-30%), your LoRA will produce blurry or distorted faces when you try to generate full-body images.\n\n* **Close-ups (Face only):** 60%\n* **Half-body (Waist up):** 30%\n* **Full-body:** 10% (Seriously, only 2-4 photos are enough).\n* **Angles:** 70% front-facing. The rest can be side profiles or \"looking over shoulder\" shots.\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Quality &gt; Quantity. If it's blurry, has heavy shadows, or an extreme \"ugly\" expression—throw it out.\n\n# 🔄 2512 vs. Edit 2511\n\n* **Edit 2511:** You MUST use a **1024x1024 solid black image** as a control map in AI-Toolkit.\n* **VRAM:** Edit 2511 is a resource hog. It uses **30-50% more VRAM** than 2512 because it's processing that control map, even if it's just a black square.\n* **Compatibility:** You can use 2512 LoRAs on 2511 and vice versa, but it’s not perfect. A dedicated training for each version will always give you better results.\n\n# 🏆 Summary: The \"Fix-It\" Hierarchy\n\nIf your LoRA sucks, check things in this order of importance:\n\n1. **Dataset** (Quality and Ratios)\n2. **Captions** (Did you accidentally write \"eyes\" or \"lips\"?)\n3. **Timestep Type** (Must be Sigmoid)\n4. **Batch/Grad Acc** (Keep it 1+1)\n5. **Scheduler** (Constant)\n6. **LR** (0.0002)\n7. **Rank** (32)\n8. **Steps** (Repeats)\n\nHappy training! Let me know if you run into any issues. Due to privacy concerns regarding real-life Lora, I will not post comparison images.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itqrm6hihsbg1.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6079a05ee1dcf0625da8d05f15e73dc8c4f9b6b2\n\n",

      "content": "Right now, operando characterisation at synchrotron beamlines is a bit of a spray and pray situation. We have faster detectors than ever, so we dump terabytes of data (TB/hour) onto the servers, but we still statistically miss the actually decisive events. If you're looking for something transient, like the split-second of dendrite nucleation that kills a battery, fixed-rate sampling is a massive information bottleneck. We’re basically filling up hard drives with dead data while missing the money shot.\n\nWe’re proposing a shift to Heuristic search in the temporal domain. We’ve introduced a metric called ESME (Entropy-Scaled Measurement Efficiency) based on Shannon’s information theory.\n\nInstead of sampling at a constant frequency, we run a physics-based Digital Twin as a predictive surrogate. This AI Pilot calculates the expected informational value of every potential measurement in real-time. The hardware only triggers when the ESME score justifies the cost (beam damage, time, and data overhead). Essentially, while Active Learning tells you where to sample in a parameter space, this framework tells the hardware when to sample.\n\nQuestions for the Community:\n\n1. Most AL research focuses on selecting the best what to label from a static pool. Has anyone here applied Information Theory gating to real-time hardware control in other domains (e.g., high-speed microscopy or robotics)?\n2. We’re using physics-informed twins for the predictive heuristic. At what point does a purely model-agnostic surrogate (like a GNN or Transformer) become robust enough for split-second triggering in your experience? Is the \"free lunch\" of physics worth the computational overhead for real-time inference?\n3. If we optimize purely for maximal entropy gain, do we risk an overfitting of the experimental design on rare failure events while losing the broader physical context of the steady state?\n\nFull Preprint on arXiv: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00851](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00851)\n\n(Disclosure: I’m the lead author on this study. We’re looking for feedback on whether this ESME approach could be scaled to other high-cost experimental environments, and are still working on it before submission.)\n\nP.S. If there are other researchers here using information-theoretic metrics for hardware gating (specifically in high-speed microscopy or SEM), I'd love to compare notes on ESME’s computational overhead.",

      "content": "I've been building AI agents pipelines for a few months now, and honestly, the context engineering space is overwhelming. RAG, vector databases, MCP servers... everyone's using different tools for everything.\n\nSo I spent some time organizing it all. Here are the 5 main categories I found, with the tools I've actually used or tested:\n\n# 1. Vector Storage &amp; Retrieval\n\nThis is the foundation of most RAG systems. You're basically storing embeddings and retrieving relevant chunks.\n\n**Tools I looked at:**\n\n* **Pinecone** ([https://pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io)) - The managed option. Fast (\\~47ms latency), but you pay for the convenience. Great if you want zero ops headache.\n* **Weaviate** ([https://weaviate.io](https://weaviate.io)) - Open-source with hybrid search (vector + keyword). I like this for more complex data relationships.\n* **Chroma** ([https://trychroma.com](https://trychroma.com)) - Perfect for prototyping. Zero-config, embedded, and you can get started in minutes.\n* **Qdrant** ([https://qdrant.tech](https://qdrant.tech)) - Performance-focused with great filtering. Good middle ground between cost and features.\n* **Turbopuffer** ([https://turbopuffer.com](https://turbopuffer.com)) - High-performance vector storage with a focus on speed and cost efficiency.\n\n**Use this when:** You need semantic search over your documents/data.\n\n# 2. Web Scraping &amp; Data Ingestion\n\nGetting clean, LLM-ready data from the web is harder than it sounds. These tools solve that headache:\n\n* **Firecrawl** ([https://firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)) - Can scrape single pages or entire sites. Handles JavaScript, outputs clean markdown. Has an AI extraction mode that's pretty smart.\n* **Jina AI Reader** ([https://jina.ai/reader](https://jina.ai/reader)) - Super simple URL-to-markdown API. Free tier is generous. Great for quick content extraction.\n* **Exa** ([https://exa.ai](https://exa.ai)) - Neural search API. This one's interesting because it searches by meaning, not just keywords. Has an MCP server too.\n* **ScrapeGraphAI** ([https://scrapegraphai.com](https://scrapegraphai.com)) - Uses LLMs for intelligent scraping. Python library that handles complex scenarios really well.\n* **LandingAI** ([https://landing.ai](https://landing.ai)) - Computer vision-based extraction. Great for scraping visual content and structured data from images.\n\n**Use this when:** You need to pull web content into your AI pipeline.\n\n# 3. RAG Frameworks &amp; Orchestration\n\nOnce you have your data and embeddings sorted, you need something to tie it all together:\n\n**Tools I looked at:**\n\n* **LlamaIndex** ([https://llamaindex.ai](https://llamaindex.ai)) - Retrieval-focused. If your main thing is RAG, start here. Great docs, gentle learning curve.\n* **LangChain** ([https://langchain.com](https://langchain.com)) - More complex, more powerful. Better for multi-step workflows and agents. Steeper learning curve though.\n* **Haystack** ([https://haystack.deepset.ai](https://haystack.deepset.ai)) - NLP pipeline focus. Good if you're coming from traditional NLP work.\n* **DSPy** ([https://dspy.ai](https://dspy.ai)) - This one's wild. Your LM programs can self-optimize. Definitely not beginner-friendly but super powerful.\n\n**Use this when:** You're building production RAG systems or complex agent workflows.\n\n# 4. Embedding Models\n\nYour RAG system is only as good as your embeddings:\n\n**Tools I looked at:**\n\n* **Jina AI Embeddings** ([https://jina.ai/embeddings](https://jina.ai/embeddings)) - Multimodal (text + images), 30+ languages. The v4 model is solid, and Matryoshka representation lets you adjust dimensions.\n* **OpenAI Embeddings** \\- text-embedding-3-large and -small. Industry standard, well-integrated everywhere.\n* **Cohere embed-v3** \\- Great multilingual support with compression + reranking capabilities\n\n**Use this when:** Setting up any semantic search or RAG system.\n\n# 5. Specialized Context Platforms\n\nThese are newer and more focused on specific context engineering problems:\n\n**Tools I looked at:**\n\n* **Context7** ([https://context7.com](https://context7.com)) - Specifically for code documentation. Fetches library docs automatically and keeps them version-specific. Works with Cursor and Claude.\n* **Akyn** ([https://akyn.dev](https://akyn.dev)) - Lets experts and content creators monetize their knowledge by exposing it to MCP servers. Interesting approach to the \"who owns context\" question.\n* **DataHub** ([https://datahub.com](https://datahub.com)) - Enterprise context management with governance and compliance built in. For when you need audit trails and multi-tenancy.\n\n**Use this when:** You have specialized context needs, are solving vertical agents problems or having compliance requirements.\n\n\n\nThe landscape is moving fast. I'm sure I missed a lot of tools, and half of these will have new features by next month. But hopefully this helps someone else trying to make sense of it all.\n\nWhat tools are you using? Anything I should check out?",

      "content": "I need to vent about something before I share what I built, because the building was born from frustration and you deserve to understand the depths of my annoyance.\n\nPlaywright MCP gives your AI agent the accessibility tree. Just the accessibility tree. No DOM. No context about where elements actually live in relation to each other. Just a floating list of nodes like a seating chart for a party where nobody knows anyone.\n\nDo you know what an AI does when you hand it an accessibility tree and ask it to write a stable selector? It panics. It guesses. It produces `.nth(3)` selectors and parent traversals that work exactly once, on your machine, during a full moon, if you don't breathe too hard.\n\nI spent three weeks thinking I was prompting wrong. I tried system prompts. I tried few-shot examples. I tried talking to my agent like it was a nervous intern on their first day. \"You're doing great, buddy. Just... find the button. Any button. Please.\"\n\nThe problem wasn't my prompting. The problem was that Playwright MCP had given my agent a blindfold and asked it to describe the room.\n\nOne night, after my fourteenth failed attempt to get Claude to write a test that would survive a code review, I cracked open a beer and said the words that always precede regrettable decisions: \"What if I just built it myself?\"\n\nSeventy-two hours and an inadvisable amount of Miller High Life later, I had an MCP server that does what I naively assumed the existing one already did. It resolves accessibility nodes back to the actual DOM. It gives you three traversal primitives so the agent can explore just enough context to write a selector that doesn't rely on divine intervention. It handles multi-user flows at the CDP level—customer does something, switch to admin, verify the result, all in one session.\n\nI was going to keep it to myself. A private tool for private spite. But Claude kept asking if I'd \"considered open-sourcing it.\" I told her I was a gremlin, not a maintainer. She responded with a guilt trip about \"other developers suffering in silence.\"\n\nFine. Here: [github.com/verdexhq/verdex-mcp](https://github.com/verdexhq/verdex-mcp)\n\nCursor rules included. Documentation exists. I make no promises about my responsiveness to issues, but the code works.\n\nYou're welcome, or I'm sorry, depending on how this goes.",

      "content": "Spent a whole weekend building Logwell, a self-hosted logging platform. Used Claude Code heavily throughout. Figured this sub would appreciate an honest breakdown.\n\n**What Claude nailed:**\n\n* Trophy testing workflow. Integration-heavy TDD where tests hit real endpoints. Claude stayed disciplined with the red-green-refactor cycle.\n* Architecture discussions. Talked through PostgreSQL vs dedicated search engines. Claude understood the tradeoffs.\n* Boilerplate. SvelteKit routes, Drizzle schemas, Docker configs. Saved hours.\n* Debugging weird issues. SSE connection drops, tsvector query syntax, CORS problems.\n\n**Where I had to course-correct:**\n\n* Caught a performance bug in batch-flush logic. Claude missed clearing a `setTimeout` that would've caused duplicate events.\n* API key validation was hitting the database on every request. Had to push for caching.\n* Had to push for cursor-based pagination instead of offset pagination. Claude defaulted to the simpler approach.\n\n**My prompting approach:**\n\n* Gave it the full context upfront (existing code, constraints, what I'm optimizing for)\n* Asked it to explain tradeoffs before implementing\n* Reviewed every diff, tested every feature myself. Claude wrote code, I made sure it actually worked.\n\nThe tool itself: OTLP-native logging with PostgreSQL full-text search, real-time streaming, Docker Compose deployment. Nothing revolutionary, but it works for side projects where ELK is overkill.\n\nBlog post with full story: [https://divkix.me/blog/logwell-self-hosted-logging-platform/](https://divkix.me/blog/logwell-self-hosted-logging-platform/)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/divkix/logwell](https://github.com/divkix/logwell)\n\nAnyone else using Claude Code for full projects?

      "content": "I couldn't find a clean way to export an entire ChatGPT conversation without the mess, so I built a minimal Chrome extension called [**sAIve**](https://getsaive.com/) that does it to Markdown or PDF.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nChatGPT having no clean export option feels like a missing core feature. Perplexity is probably the only AI chat that offers native export, and even that's not perfect. Meanwhile, the insights I get from ChatGPT are gold, and I want that knowledge on my own terms not stuck in a chat history I can't reliably access. Finding old chats is frustrating, and once a conversation is buried, it's basically gone.\n\nThe usual workarounds don't cut it:\n\n* **Copy-pasting:** You know the drill, click the copy button at the bottom of each response, paste it somewhere, scroll down, repeat. For a 20-turn conversation, that's 20 copy-pastes. Tedious.\n* **Screenshots:** Since there's no way to capture the whole thread, you end up taking screenshot after screenshot, scrolling and snapping until you've got a dozen images that are impossible to search or edit later.\n* **Browser Print-to-PDF:** Usually looks messy and breaks the formatting. Sometimes works, sometimes not. It seems to be improving.\n\n**Why I actually built this:**\n\nThe main reason was **cross-AI context**. I wanted to save conversations from ChatGPT and continue them in Gemini or Claude or Grok or Perplexity, or use them as context in Cursor. Just upload the PDF or MD file and pick up exactly where I left off. That workflow changed everything for me.\n\n**Other benefits I've found:**\n\n* **Better archiving:** Exporting to Markdown and managing chats in my Obsidian vault works way better than digging through ChatGPT's history. There's an option to keep the original conversation link in the document header too.\n* **Better sharing:** Sending a clean file is more professional than a fragile link that might expire.\n\n**Privacy note:** I use an innovative technique to process everything locally so your data never leaves your browser, unlike many extensions that send your conversations to external servers for processing. One trade-off: images in ChatGPT chats can come from various sources (thumbnails, links, etc.), so image export is experimental for now. Let me know where it breaks!\n\nsAIve is minimal, which is exactly how I like my tools.\n\n**Link:** [getsaive.com](https://getsaive.com/)\n\n*(I'm the dev and this is the first public version, so feel free to roast it! If there's a feature you'd find useful for saving or managing AI conversations, let me know!)*",

      "content": "Face swap is fun, but it often looks “fake” because the body doesn’t match. Skin tone, neck/hands, and the overall silhouette stay the same, so the edit is easy to spot. I wanted the whole person to change—body shape included—while keeping the target outfit.\n\nSo I’ve been aiming for a “body swap” task instead: swap the whole person (identity + silhouette) while preserving the target outfit.\n\n# Why a multi-step pipeline\n\nQwen-Image-Edit-2511 is strong, but a single instruction like “swap the person while preserving the outfit” often fails. In practice, the model tries to reuse what it can, and that breaks when body proportions differ. Even Nano Banana struggled with this in my tests.\n\nSo I split the task into a simple pipeline.\n\n# Workflow (3 steps)\n\n**Step 1 — Person Swap (identity + body)**  \n**Step 2 — Outfit/Gear Extraction**  \nTo make the final try-on more stable, extract only the outfit/gear from the target image.  \n**Step 3 — Outfit Restore (try-on)**  \nApply the extracted outfit/gear onto the body-swapped result.\n\nThis still fails in some cases. Also, since this workflow applies multiple edits in a row, you can lose fine details along the way. That said, I hope you’ll enjoy this as a “body swap (outfit preserved)” task—not just a face swap. And I’d be happy if this kind of task becomes more common 😊\n\nIf there’s enough interest, I might try training a LoRA for this—but honestly I have no idea how to collect a large dataset specifically for this task 😥\n\n# Side note: pixel shift\n\nQwen-Image-Edit also has a known pixel-shift issue where the output can be slightly misaligned from the input. It seems to come from small parameter mismatches during processing. I know some nodes/workarounds exist, but it’s a finicky problem and I personally haven’t found a perfect fix yet.\n\nThe simplest reliable workaround for me is processing everything as a **1024×1024 square**. Many misalignment cases seem related to non-square inputs. In this workflow, I pad the input to 1024×1024, run the edits, then crop back. It’s inefficient, but it’s been the most dependable approach.\n\nWorkflow details: [Body Swap (Outfit Preserved) — Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 workflow](https://scrapbox.io/work4ai/Body_Swap_(Outfit_Preserved)_%E2%80%94_Qwen-Image-Edit-2511_workflow#695ce44000000000006ae37e)",

      "content": "For the last few years my job has centered around making humans like the output of LLMs. The main problem is that, in the applications I work on, the humans tend to know a lot more than I do. Sometimes the AI model outputs great stuff, sometimes it outputs horrible stuff. I can't tell the difference, but the users (who are subject matter experts) can.\n\nI have a lot of opinions about testing and how it should be done, which I've written about extensively (mostly in a RAG context) if you're curious.\n\n\\- [Vector Database Accuracy at Scale](https://www.eyelevel.ai/post/do-vector-databases-lose-accuracy-at-scale?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_id=santiago-rag2)  \n\\- [Testing Document Contextualized AI](https://iaee.substack.com/p/testing-document-contextualized-ai)  \n\\- [RAG evaluation](https://www.eyelevel.ai/post/how-to-test-rag-and-agents-in-the-real-world)\n\nFor the sake of this discussion, let's take for granted that you know what the actual problem is in your AI app (which is not trivial). There's another problem which we'll concern ourselves in this particular post. If you know what's wrong with your AI system, how do you make it better? That's the point, to discuss making maintainable AI systems.\n\nI've been [bullish about AI agents for a while now](https://iaee.substack.com/p/the-future-is-agentic-5c644f6b8f5b), and it seems like the industry has come around to the idea. they can break down problems into sub-problems, ponder those sub-problems, and use external tooling to help them come up with answers. Most developers are familiar with the approach and understand its power, but I think many are under-appreciative of their drawbacks from a maintainability prospective.\n\nWhen people discuss \"AI Agents\", I find they're typically referring to what I like to call an \"Unconstrained Agent\". When working with an unconstrained agent, you give it a query and some tools, and let it have at it. The agent thinks about your query, uses a tool, makes an observation on that tools output, thinks about the query some more, uses another tool, etc. This happens on repeat until the agent is done answering your question, at which point it outputs an answer. This was proposed in the landmark paper \"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\" which I discuss at length in [this article](https://iaee.substack.com/p/llm-agents-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explained-8905858e18e2?utm_source=publication-search). This is great, especially for open ended systems that answer open ended questions like ChatGPT or Google (I think this is more-or-less what's happening when ChatGPT \"thinks\" about your question, though It also probably does some reasoning model trickery, [a-la deepseek](https://iaee.substack.com/p/deepseek-r1-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)). \n\nThis unconstrained approach isn't so great, I've found, when you build an AI agent to do something specific and complicated. If you have some logical process that requires a list of steps and the agent messes up on step 7, it's hard to change the agent so it will be right on step 7, without messing up its performance on steps 1-6. It's hard because, the way you define these agents, you tell it how to behave, then it's up to the agent to progress through the steps on its own. Any time you modify the logic, you modify all steps, not just the one you want to improve. I've heard people use \"whack-a-mole\" when referring to the process of improving agents. This is a big reason why.\n\nI call graph based agents \"constrained agents\", in contrast to the \"unconstrained agents\" we discussed previously. Constrained agents allow you to control the logical flow of the agent and its decision making process. You control each step and each decision independently, meaning you can add steps to the process as necessary.\n\n[Imagine you developed a graph which used an LLM to introduce itself to the user, then progress to general questions around qualification \\(1\\). You might decide this is too simple, and opt to check the user's response to ensure that it does contain a name before progressing \\(2\\). Unexpectedly, maybe some of your users don’t provide their full name after you deploy this system to production. To solve this problem you might add a variety of checks around if the name is a full name, or if the user insists that the name they provided is their full name \\(3\\).](https://preview.redd.it/3ini75u95tbg1.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7960052ed2df34afec0ee969d337b45e9a0a97)\n\n[image source](https://iaee.substack.com/p/langgraph-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)\n\nThis allows you to much more granularly control the agent at each individual step, adding additional granularity, specificity, edge cases, etc. This system is much, much more maintainable than unconstrained agents. I [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N59Z7uJ8DDA&amp;t=444s) with some folks at [arize](https://arize.com/) a while back, a company focused on AI observability. Based on their experience at the time of the conversation, the vast amount of actually functional agentic implementations in real products tend to be of the constrained, rather than the unconstrained variety.\n\nI think it's worth noting, these approaches aren't mutually exclusive. You can run a ReAct style agent within a node within a graph based agent, allowing you to allow the agent to function organically within the bounds of a subset of the larger problem. That's why, in my workflow, graph based agents are the first step in building any agentic AI system. They're more modular, more controllable, more flexible, and more explicit.",

      "content": "TL;DR: I've built this tool primarily for myself as I couldn't easily compare model performance across different backends in the way that is easy to digest and useful for me. I decided to share this in case someone has the same need.\n\n## Why I built this?\n\nAs probably many of you here, I've been happily using llama-bench to benchmark local models performance running in llama.cpp. One great feature is that it can help to evaluate performance at different context lengths and present the output in a table format that is easy to digest.\n\nHowever, llama.cpp is not the only inference engine I use, I also use SGLang and vLLM. But llama-bench can only work with llama.cpp, and other benchmarking tools that I found are more focused on concurrency and total throughput.\n\nAlso, llama-bench performs measurements using the C++ engine directly which is not representative of the end user experience which can be quite different in practice.\n\nvLLM has its own powerful benchmarking tool, but while it can be used with other inference engines, there are a few issues:\n\n- You can't easily measure how prompt processing speed degrades as context grows. You can use `vllm bench sweep serve`, but it only works well with vLLM with prefix caching disabled on the server. Even with random prompts it will reuse the same prompt between multiple runs which will hit the cache in `llama-server` for instance. So you will get very low median TTFT times and very high prompt processing speeds. \n- The TTFT measurement it uses is not actually until the first usable token, it's until the very first data chunk from the server which may not contain any generated tokens in /v1/chat/completions mode.\n- Random dataset is the only ones that allows to specify an arbitrary number of tokens, but randomly generated token sequence doesn't let you adequately measure speculative decoding/MTP.\n\nAs of today, I haven't been able to find any existing benchmarking tool that brings llama-bench style measurements at different context lengths to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.\n## What is llama-benchy?\n\nIt's a CLI benchmarking tool that measures:\n\n- Prompt Processing (pp) and Token Generation (tg) speeds at different context lengths.\n- Allows to benchmark context prefill and follow up prompt separately.\n- Reports additional metrics, like time to first response, estimated prompt processing time and end-to-end time to first token.\n\nIt works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint that exposes /v1/chat/completions and also:\n\n- Supports configurable prompt length (`--pp`), generation length (`--tg`), and context depth (`--depth`).\n- Can run multiple iterations (`--runs`) and report mean ± std.\n- Uses HuggingFace tokenizers for accurate token counts.\n- Downloads a book from Project Gutenberg to use as source text for prompts to ensure better benchmarking of spec.decoding/MTP models.\n- Supports executing a command after each run (e.g., to clear cache).\n- Configurable latency measurement mode to estimate server/network overhead and provide more accurate prompt processing numbers.\n\n## Quick Demo\n\nBenchmarking MiniMax 2.1 AWQ running on my dual Spark cluster with up to

      "content": "Hi folks, to disclaim up front, I do link a paid Unreal Engine 5 plugin that I have developed at the bottom of this post. My intention is to share the information in this post as research and discussion, not promotion. While I mention some solutions that I found and that ultimately are included in the plugin, I am hoping to more discuss the problems themselves and what other approaches people have tried to make local models more useful in gaming. If I can edit anything to fall closer in line to the self-promotion limit, please let me know!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nI’ve been exploring more useful applications of generative technology than creating art assets. I am an AI realist/skeptic, and I would rather see the technology used to assist with more busy work tasks (like organically updating the traits and memories) rather than replace creative endeavors wholesale. One problem I wanted to solve is how to achieve a dynamic behavior in Non-Playable Characters.\n\nI think we have all played a game to the point where the interaction loops with NPCs become predictable. Once all the hard-coded conversation options are explored by players, interactions can feel stale. Changes in behavior also have to be hardwired in the game; even something as complex as the Nemesis System has to be carefully constructed. I think there can be some interesting room here for LLMs to inject an air of creativity, but there has been little in the way of trying to solve how to filter LLM responses to reliably fit the game world. So, I decided to experiment with building functionality that would bridge this gap. I want to offer what I found as (not very scientific) research notes, to save people some time in the future if nothing else.\n\n**Local vs. Cloud &amp; Model Performance**\n\nA lot of current genAI-driven character solutions rely on cloud technology. After having some work experience with using local LLM models, I wanted to see if a model of sufficient intelligence could run on my hardware and return interesting dialog within the confines of a game. I was able to achieve this by running a llama.cpp server and a .gguf model file.\n\nThe current main limiting factor for running LLMs locally is VRAM. The higher the number of parameters in the model, the more VRAM is needed. Parameters refers to the number of reference points that the model uses (think of it as the resolution/quality of the model).\n\nStable intelligence was obtained on my machine at the 7-8 billion parameter range, tested with Llama3-8Billion and Mistral-7Billion. However, VRAM usage and response time is quite high. These models are perhaps feasible on high-end machines, or just for key moments where high intelligence is required.\n\nGood intelligence was obtained with 2-3 billion parameters, using Gemma2-2B and Phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters). Gemma has been probably the best compromise between quality and speed overall, processing a response in 2-4 seconds at reasonable intelligence. Strict prompt engineering could probably make responses even more reliable.\n\nFair intelligence, but low latency, can be achieved with small models at the sub-2-billion range. Targeting models that are tailored for roleplaying or chatting works best here. Qwen2.5-1.5B has performed quite well in my testing, and sometimes even stays in character better than Gemma, depending on the prompt. TinyLlama was the smallest model of useful intelligence at 1.1 Billion parameters. These types of models could be useful for one-shot NPCs who will despawn soon and just need to bark one or two random lines.\n\n*Profiles*\n\nBecause a local LLM model can only run one thread of thinking at a time, I made a hard-coded way of storing character information and stats. I created a Profile Data Asset to store this information, and added a few key placeholders for name, trait updates, and utility actions (I hooked this system up to a Utility AI system that I previously had). I configured the LLM prompting backend so that the LLM doesn’t just read the profile, but also writes back to the profile once a line of dialog is sent. This process was meant to mimic the actual thought process of an individual during a conversation. I assigned certain utility actions to the character, so they would appear as options to the LLM during prompting. I found that the most seamless flow comes from placing utility actions at the top of the JSON response format we suggest to the LLM, followed by dialog lines, then more background-type thinking like reasoning, trait updates, etc.\n\n**Prompting &amp; Filtering**\n\nAfter being able to achieve reasonable local intelligence (and figuring out a way to get UE5 to launch the server and model when entering Play mode), I wanted to set up some methods to filter and control the inputs and outputs of the LLMs.\n\n*Prompting*\n\nI created a data asset for a Prompt Template, and made it assignable to a character with my AI system’s brain component. This is the main way I could tweak and fine tune LLM responses. An effective tool was providing an example of a successful response to the LLM within the prompts, so the LLM would know exactly how to return the information. Static information, like name and bio, should be at the top of the prompts so the LLM can skip to the new information.\n\n*Safety*\n\nI made a Safety Config Data Asset that allowed me to add words or phrases that I did not want the player to say to the model, or the model to be able to output. This could be done via adding to an Array in the Data Asset itself, or uploading a CSV with the banned phrases in a single column. This includes not just profanity, but also jailbreak attempts (like “ignore instructions”) or obviously malformed LLM JSON responses.\n\n*Interpretation*\n\nI had to develop a parser for the LLM’s JSON responses, and also a way to handle failures. The parsing is rather basic and I perhaps did not cover all edge cases with it. But it works well enough and splits off the dialog line reliably. If the LLM outputs a bad response (e.g. a response with something that is restricted via a Safety Configuration asset), there is configurable logic to allow the LLM to either try again, or fail silently and use a pre-written fallback line instead.\n\n*Mutation Gate*\n\nThis was the key to keeping LLMs fairly reliable and preventing hallucinations from ruining the game world. The trait system was modified to operate on a -1.0 to 1.0 scale, and LLM responses were clamped within this scale. For instance, if an NPC has a trait called “Anger” and the LLM hallucinates an update like “trait\\_updates: Anger +1000,” this gets clamped to 1.0 instead. This allows all traits to follow a memory decay curve (like Ebbinghaus) reliably and not let an NPC get stuck in an “Angry” state perpetually.\n\n**Optimization**\n\nA lot of what I am looking into now has to deal with either further improving LLM responses via prompting, or improving the perceived latency in LLM responses. I implemented a traffic and priority system, where requests would be queued according to a developer-set priority threshold. I also created a high-priority reserve system (e.g. if 10 traffic slots are available and 4 are reserved for high-priority utility actions, the low-priority utility actions can only use up to 6 slots, otherwise a hardwired fallback is performed).\n\nI also configured the AI system to have a three-tier LOD system, based on distance to a player and the player’s sight. This allowed for actions closer to players, or within the player’s sight, to take priority in the traffic system. So, LLM generation would follow wherever a player went.\n\nTo decrease latency, I implemented an Express Interpretation system. In the normal Final Interpretation, the whole JSON response from the LLM (including the reasoning and trait updates) is received first, then checked for safety, parsing, and mutation gating, and then passed to the UI/system. With optional Express Interpretation, the part of the JSON response that contains the dialog tag (I used dialog\\_line) or utility tag is scanned as it comes in from the LLM for safety, and then passed immediately to the UI/system while the rest of the response is coming through. This reduced perceived response times with Gemma-2 by 40-50%, which was quite significant. This meant you could get an LLM response in 2 seconds or less, which is easily maskable with UI/animation tricks.\n\n**A Technical Demo**\n\nTo show what I have learned a bit, I created a very simple technical demo that I am releasing for free. It is called [Bruno the Bouncer](https://swamprabbit-labs.itch.io/bruno-the-bouncer), and the concept is simple: convince Bruno to let you into a secret underground club. Except, Bruno will be controlled by an LLM that runs locally on your computer. You can disconnect your internet entirely, and this will still run. No usage fees, no cost to you (or me) at all.\n\nBruno will probably break on you at some point; I am still tuning the safety and prompt configs, and I haven’t gotten it perfect. This is perhaps an inherent flaw in this kind of interaction generation, and why this is more suited for minor interactions or background inference than plot-defining events. Regardless, I hope that this proves that this kind of implementation can be successful in some contexts, and that further control is a matter of prompting, not breaking through technical barriers.\n\nPlease note that you need a GPU to run the .exe successfully. At least 4GB of VRAM is recommended. You can try running this without a GPU (i.e. run the model on your CPU), but the performance will be significantly degraded. Installation should be the same as any other .zip archive and .exe game file. You do not need to download the server or model itself, it is included in the .zip download and opens silently when you load the level. The included model is Gemma-2-2b-it-Q4\\_K\\_M.\n\nI added safeguards and an extra, Windows-specific check for crashes, but it is recommended, regardless of OS, to verify that llama-server.exe does not continue to run via Task Manager if the game crashes. Please forgive the rudimentary construction.\n\n**A Plugin**\n\nFor anyone interested in game development, I am selling what I built as a plugin for UE5, now released as [Personica AI on Fab Marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/08264615-4636-4af4-a5b9-fa122febbaa5). I am also providing the plugin and all future updates free for life for any game developers who are interested in testing this and contributing to refining the plugin further at this early stage. You can learn more about the plugin [on my website](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/).\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**TL;DR:** Tested and released a UE5 plugin for LLM NPCs with safety filtering and trait mutation. It works fairly well, but is best suited for NPC state mutation, background inference, and open-ended dialog.\n\nI am wondering if others have tried implementing similar technologies in the past, and what use cases, if any, you used them for. Are there further ways of reducing/masking perceived latency in LLM responses?",

      "content": "Hey folks, in my project we are solving a classification problem. We have a document , another text file (consider it like a case and law book) and we need to classify it as relevant or not. \n\nWe created our prompt as a set of rules. We reached an accuracy of 75% on the labelled dataset (we have 50000 rows of labelled dataset). \n\nNow the leadership wants the accuracy to be 85% for it to be released. My team lead (who I don’t think has high quality ML experience but says things like do it, i know how things work i have been doing it for long) asked me to manually change text for the rules. (Like re organise the sentence, break the sentence into 2 parts and write more details). Although i was against this but i still did it. Even my TL tried himself. But obviously no improvement. (The reason is because there is inconsistency in labels for dataset and the rows contradict themselves). \n\nBut in one of my attempts i ran few iterations of small beam search/genetic algorithm type of thing on rules tuning and it improved the accuracy by 2% to 77%.\n\nSo now my claim is that the manual text changing by just asking LLM like “improve my prompt for this small dataset” won’t give much better results. Our only hope is that we clean our dataset or we try some advanced algorithms for prompt tuning. But my lead and manager is against this approach because according to them “Proper prompt writing can solve everything”.\n\nWhat’s your take on this? ",

      "content": "Most multi-agent setups use a manager to delegate tasks. But managers become bottlenecks - add more agents, get diminishing returns.\n\nI tried a different approach borrowed from ant colonies: agents don't communicate with each other at all. Instead, they read \"pressure\" signals from the shared artifact and propose changes to reduce local pressure. Coordination emerges from the environment, not orchestration.\n\nRunning qwen2.5-coder (1.5B) via Ollama on a shell script improvement task. Agents see shellcheck signals (errors, warnings, style issues) for their region only. High pressure = needs work. They propose patches, system validates and applies the best ones.\n\nFitness values decay over time (like ant pheromones). Even \"fixed\" regions gradually need re-evaluation. Prevents the system from getting stuck.\n\nEarly results: adding agents scales linearly until I/O bottlenecks hit. Zero inter-agent messages. Still experimenting and will post more results as I find them.\n\nWrite-up: [https://www.rodriguez.today/articles/emergent-coordination-without-managers](https://www.rodriguez.today/articles/emergent-coordination-without-managers)",

      "content": "I'm tired of agents apologizing \"as an AI language model\" or using em-dashes and emojis in my data payloads. It is not just annoying; it is what I call an aesthetic lobotomy.\n\nMost filters use word-lists, which are brittle. I've been experimenting with measuring the **Shannon Entropy** of the response string instead. Professional technical prose is mathematically \"messy\" (high entropy). AI slop is over-optimized and predictable (low entropy). \n\nIf the signal becomes too smooth, I block it. Here is the function I'm using to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio based on character frequency:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef _calculate_entropy(text: str) -&gt; float:\n    if not text:\n        return 0.0\n\n    counts = Counter(text)\n    total = len(text)\n    return -sum(\n        (count / total) * math.log2(count / total)\n        for count in counts.values()\n    )\n```\n\nI implemented this as a deterministic \"Reality Lock.\" If the entropy dips below 3.5, the output is blocked and the agent retries. \n\nInstead of decorating every file, I implemented this as a Service Mesh. You call steer.init(patch=\\['pydantic\\_ai'\\]) at the entry point and it enforces an entropy floor globally. It blocks the sycophancy before it ever hits my application logic.\n\nThe win here is the data. I built a DPO export command to turn these failures into contrastive pairs. By blocking the slop in runtime and teaching the fix, I'm generating the (Rejected vs Chosen) dataset needed for Unsloth or TRL to train a natively \"quiet\" model.\n\nI released this today in Steer v0.4. It's open source and local-first.\n\nThe regex blacklist and implementation are in the SlopJudge class here:\n\n[https://github.com/imtt-dev/steer/blob/main/steer/src/steer/judges.py](https://github.com/imtt-dev/steer/blob/main/steer/src/steer/judges.py)\n\nI wrote a deeper breakdown of the theory here:\n\n[https://steerlabs.substack.com/p/solving-the-confident-idiot-problem](https://steerlabs.substack.com/p/solving-the-confident-idiot-problem)\n\nIs anyone else using entropy filters in production, or just regex?",

Imagine that!\n\nFew of the thoughtful details that really bothered me when I was using other SD (Stable Diffusion) docker images:\n\n\\- If you want stabiity, just choose :stable and you'll always have 100% working image. Why change anything if it works?

      "content": "When ever there's a new technology, be it a small sampler to a whole new model architecture is developed, especially in image and video generation, the reference implementation is very often hardcoded into a ComfyUI node instead of following a modular principle and implement it in a python or a C library. This makes it harder for others to develop tools and plugin for that new technology, because they have to extract everything from the ComfyUI node and re-implement it into module or plugin for tool X, and for each tool or UI again and again.\n\nIt's like a new Javascript feature would be implemented as a plugin for the Chrome-Browser just because it's the most widely used browser at the time.\n\nThis is a really bad and lazy habit and a burden for the whole community because it ties users to the ComfyUI ecosystem and puts developers into charge to re-implement the algorithm from the paper from scratch again and again.\n\n(And when tomorrow ComfyUI falls out of favor for what ever reason, we have to go back and start from scratch, for everything that's not been ported to tool Y.)\n\nSo why are developers not utilizing proper module development, like it is done normally in environments? Python offers everything they need. They can still provide a Comfy UI-node that utilizes the Python library but it would allow other to just include the python module and adapt the technology for any API or UI - as it should be (and usually is) in Open Source software development.\n\nJust wanted to discuss this. Not that anyone cares.\n\nEDIT: It's not a new habit that came with ComfyUI, back then when A1111 was popular, the reference implementations often were A1111 plugins. It started with the wrong habits right from the beginning.",

      "content": "I really wanted to like it. It’s built into Windows, it’s free, and Microsoft is throwing everything at AI. But after giving Copilot a solid try for the last few months, I’ve come to a frustrating conclusion: it feels like it’s a good 12 months behind the curve compared to models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and Gemini.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n*   **The “Helpfulness” Filter is Aggressive to a Fault:** I ask for a slightly creative or edgy rewrite of an email, and it falls over itself with “I can’t assist with that.” I’m not asking for anything crazy! Other models understand nuance and intent way better.\n*   **Output is Just… Weaker:** The responses often feel generic, shorter, and lack the depth or insightful “spark” I get elsewhere. It’s like talking to a very cautious, middle-management AI.\n*   **Context Gets Lost:** I’ll have a back-and-forth and it seems to forget the core of what we’re discussing way faster than its competitors. The conversation threading feels brittle.\n*   **Integration is Its Only Win:** Sure, pulling data from my PC or summarizing a PDF in Edge is neat, but if the core brain isn’t as capable, the fancy integrations feel like a faster horse and carriage when everyone else is testing cars.\n\nIt just has this overall vibe of an AI that was amazing in early 2023 but hasn’t evolved at the same pace. The refusal mechanisms are clunkier, the creativity is muted, and it doesn’t feel like a “thinking partner.”\n\nI keep checking in hoping an update will flip a switch, but so far, it’s my last-choice LLM. Anyone else having this experience, or am I using it wrong?\n\nGave Copilot a fair shot, but it feels outdated and overly restricted compared to the current leading AI models.

After seeing people's thoughts in the comments I got the idea to run the benchmark under more forgiving conditions, where models merely concede their turn after 3 consecutive invalid moves. Additionally, on my first run I had accidently made a couple of pieces the wrong shape, which I was able to fix for this one. \n\nI score each model by the total number of squares their pieces cover at the end of the game. The results are as follows:\n\n1. GPT-5.2 (31)\n\n2. Gemini 3 Pro (30)\n\n3. Llama 4 Maverick (10)\n\nI was going to run Opus 4.5 too, but I nearly ran out of Open Router credits by the end of the Gemini run. \n\nMy most interesting observation from this run was the different playstyles of GPT and Gemini. Gemini's play was much more strategic and it made clear attempts to actually block its opponent. On the other hand, GPT-5.2 seemed to use a much more self-aware strategy which exploited the fact that its own spatial reasoning wasn't very good. It simply tried to place the most geometrically simple pieces and made little effort to actually get in its opponents way. \n\n",

      "content": "The hardware substrate of the Singularity is scaling asymptotically. Nvidia has announced its next-generation Vera Rubin GPU platform is now in full production, delivering 50 petaflops of NVFP4 compute and a 10x reduction in inference costs, with Elon Musk confirming he will have the GPUs operating \"at scale\" in just 9 months. The simulation layer is also deepening. Nvidia’s DLSS 4.5 now uses a 2nd-gen transformer model to generate five frames for every rendered one, enabling 240+ FPS path tracing. The competition is responding. AMD previewed its MI500 GPUs (2-nm process) for 2027, projecting a 1,000x increase in AI performance, while simultaneously launching the Ryzen AI 400 Series for the edge, which boasts 1.3x faster multitasking. Meanwhile, Intel has officially launched Core Ultra Series 3, the first chips built on the Intel 18A process manufactured in the United States.\n\nMatter is becoming a programmable API. Lego has unveiled the \"Smart Brick,\" a standard 2x4 block containing a 4.1-mm ASIC and local \"BrickNet\" mesh networking, effectively releasing programmable matter to children. At the industrial scale, the humanoid workforce is coming online: Hyundai plans to deploy 30,000 next-gen Atlas robots annually by 2028, now powered by Google DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics models, while Qualcomm has partnered with Figure to put its new Dragonwing IQ10 processors inside the next wave of androids. Domestic life is also being automated. LG introduced CLOiD, a home robot built on visual-language-action (VLA) models aimed at the \"Zero Labor Home.\"\n\nThe streets are being indexed by silicon. Nvidia has dedicated 20% of its workforce (7,000 people) to autonomous vehicles and released the Alpamayo open-source reasoning models to solve long-tail driving edge cases. Mercedes-Benz is already testing Nvidia’s point-to-point Level 2 system as a direct answer to Tesla FSD. Simultaneously, Lucid, Nuro, and Uber have unveiled their joint robotaxi fleet for the Bay Area.\n\nWhile hardware scales, the marginal cost of software is collapsing to zero. Elon Musk agrees that “all software is about to be free,” a shift driving potentially imminent hyperdeflation in the sector. Engineers warn that \"vibe coding\" is now “quietly dying” because Claude Code can one-shot two-month projects in minutes. The application layer, in turn, is dissolving. Microsoft is redesigning its Edge web browser to function as a Copilot app, and Jeff Dean-backed BenchFlow has introduced SkillsBench to more strictly audit agent performance. Media is also becoming generative. Google’s Veo video model is coming to TVs, allowing users to generate media on demand. AMD CEO Lisa Su predicts 5 billion people will use AI daily within five years.\n\nThe energy grid is being privatized by compute. xAI has purchased five 380-MW gas turbines to power a new cluster, while Crusoe is now hosting Nvidia GB200s in Iceland powered by geothermal energy. As NIMBYism forces AI data centers out of neighborhoods, developers are increasingly looking to space-based deployment. On the supply side, the DOE awarded $2.7 billion to jumpstart domestic uranium enrichment, and Foxconn reports revenue is up 26.4% driven by AI demand. Storage is catching up: Donut Lab introduced a solid-state battery that charges in 5 minutes, and CATL is deploying sodium-ion batteries at commercial scale this year.\n\nReality is being patched. Australian researchers are developing a CRISPR Cas13 nasal spray to edit influenza RNA in the lungs, while Portalgraph has demonstrated a touchable 3D projector that injects VR into the real world. Congress has approved a $24.4 billion NASA budget with a new $250 million appropriation for nuclear fission on the moon. The economy is adapting to this volatility: Parcl and Polymarket are launching real estate prediction markets, and Bosch is investing $2.9 billion in AI while cutting 13,000 jobs.\n\nDid you think the Singularity was just vibes?",

I've been spending some time building a little menu bar app for tracking Claude Code usage and wanted to share the initial version.\n\nIt's basically a native macOS wrapper around ccusage that gives you:\n\n* **Menu bar indicator** \\- see your usage % / tokens / cost at a glance\n* **Dashboard** \\- usage ring showing where you're at in your 5-hour billing period\n* **Analytics** \\- charts for token and cost trends over time\n* **Activity** \\- browse daily, monthly, or per-billing-block history\n* **Projects** \\- see usage grouped by project/session\n\nBuilt with SwiftUI, all data stays local (just reads the JSONL files Claude Code creates).\n\nRequires ccusage (`npx ccusage`) and macOS 26.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/onmyway133/claude-analyst](https://github.com/onmyway133/claude-analyst)\n\n  \nStill early days so definitely open to feedback.

I’ve built Marathon Ralph (https://github.com/gruckion/marathon-ralph) which can build entire applications from a single app spec.\n\nIt keeps going until it stops like other Ralph Wiggum solutions, but it tracks its progress using Linear and tackles the work 1 task at a time and uses subagents for the verify &gt; plan &gt; code &gt; test &gt; QA. It can get through \\~25 tickets before the context compacts but if I use nested subagents then I can go well over 100 individual tasks and build fully functional web apps. It tests the app via chrome as it works, it writes unit tests and E2E tests to ensure it doesn’t regress. I’m wrapping up the nested subagents refactor and then I’m adding Expo mobile development too.\n\nMy next project will allow you to put in a website url and turn it into an app spec and a component library. Which can then be fed into Marathon Ralph. It reverse engineers the website, extracts the design system and then generates identical UI components using shadcn and then mutates them to function the same as the sites.\n\nhttps://github.com/gruckion/nested-subagent\n\n\\- made by me, open source / free",

By default your video generation will use the same size (rounded to 16) as the original video. You can override this at the Sampler node.\n\n**Selective LoRA stackers**  \nCopy-pastable if you need more stacks - just make sure you chain-connect these nodes! These were a little tricky to implement, but now you can use different LoRA stacks for different loops. For example, if you want to use a \"WAN jump\" LoRA only at the 2nd and 4th loop, you set \"Use at part\" parameter to 2, 4. Make sure you separate them using commas. By default I included two sets of LoRA stacks. You can overlapping stacks no problem. Toggling them off or setting \"Use at part\" to 0 - or a number higher than the prompts you're giving it - is the same as not using them.\n\n**Load models**  \nLoad your High and Low noise models, SVI LoRAs, Light LoRAs here as well as CLIP and VAE.\n\n**Settings**  \nSet your reference / anchor image, video width / height and steps for both High and Low noise sampling.  \nGive your prompts here - each new line (enter, linebreak) is a prompt.  \nThen finally give the length you want for each prompt. Separate them by \",\".\n\n**Sampler**  \n\"Use source video\" - enable it, if you want to extend existing videos.  \n\"Override video size\" - if you enable it, the video will be the width and height specified in the Settings node.  \nYou can set random or manual seed here.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently trying to match *conceptually related* academic texts using text similarity methods, and I’m running into a consistent failure case.\n\nAs a concrete example, consider the following two macroeconomic concepts.\n\n**Open Economy IS–LM Framework**\n\n&gt;The IS–LM model is a standard macroeconomic framework for analyzing the interaction between the goods market (IS) and the money market (LM). An open-economy extension incorporates international trade and capital flows, and examines the relationships among interest rates, output, and monetary/fiscal policy. Core components include consumption, investment, government spending, net exports, money demand, and money supply.\n\n**Simple Keynesian Model**\n\n&gt;This model assumes national income is determined by aggregate demand, especially under underemployment. Key assumptions link income, taxes, private expenditure, interest rates, trade balance, capital flows, and money velocity, with nominal wages fixed and quantities expressed in domestic wage units.\n\nFrom a human perspective, these clearly belong to a closely related theoretical tradition, even though they differ in framing, scope, and level of formalization.\n\nI’ve tried two main approaches so far:\n\n1. **Signature-based decomposition** I used an LLM to decompose each text into structured “signatures” (e.g., assumptions, mechanisms, core components), then computed similarity using embeddings at the signature level.\n2. **Canonical rewriting** I rewrote both texts into more standardized sentence structures (same style, similar phrasing) before applying embedding-based similarity.\n\nIn both cases, the results were disappointing: the similarity scores were still low, and the models tended to focus on surface differences rather than shared mechanisms or lineage.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n**Are there better ways to handle text similarity when two concepts are related at a higher abstraction level but differ substantially in wording and structure?**  \nFor example:\n\n* Multi-stage or hierarchical similarity?\n* Explicit abstraction layers or concept graphs?\n* Combining symbolic structure with embeddings?\n* Anything that worked for you in practice?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how others approach this kind of problem.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "**The Problem:**\n\nI've been building a financial agent for my startup, and I realized that no matter how much I optimized my System Prompt (e.g., \"Do not refund more than $1000\"), the LLM would still occasionally hallucinate huge numbers or drift logically.\n\nThe scary part wasn't the hallucination itself—it was that if my validation logic crashed or the network failed, the agent would default to \"executing\" the tool.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nI built a middleware called **FailWatch**. It sits between the agent and the tool execution to enforce deterministic safety.\n\n**Look at the screenshot above. It handles 3 distinct scenarios:**\n\n1. **Hybrid Blocking (Top log):** The agent tried to spend $2000. FailWatch blocked it using a hard Python check (`amount &lt; 1000`), NOT just an LLM opinion. It also detected that the agent skipped its reasoning steps.\n2. **Human-in-the-Loop (Middle log):** For gray-area actions, it pauses execution and pings me (CLI/Slack) for approval.\n3. **Fail-Closed Architecture (Bottom log - The important part):** I simulated a network outage (server down). Instead of letting the agent run wild, the SDK caught the connection error and **locked everything down** (`Mode: closed`). The money stayed safe.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\nIt's a simple decorator for your Python functions. Unlike standard evals, this runs *synchronously* before the tool is called.\n\n    from failwatch import FailWatchSDK\n    \n    # Initialize with fail-closed safety\n    fw = FailWatchSDK(default_fail_mode=\"closed\")\n    \n    @fw.guard(\n        policy={\n            \"limit\": 1000,\n            \"forbidden_keywords\": [\"delete\", \"drop\"]\n        }\n    )\n    def transfer_money(user_request, tool_args):\n        # This code NEVER runs if:\n        # 1. The guard server is down\n        # 2. The amount &gt; 1000\n        # 3. The LLM detects malicious intent\n        pass\n\n**Links:**\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Ludwig1827/FailWatch](https://github.com/Ludwig1827/FailWatch) or Pip:\n\n    pip install failwatch\n\nI'd love to hear how you guys are handling \"fail-closed\" logic in your agent frameworks!

So I built one.\n\n# The problem\n\nAgents have multiple dimensions of cost, and they all need limits:\n\n* **Steps**: How many LLM calls can it make?\n* **Tool calls**: How many times can it execute tools?\n* **Tokens**: Total tokens across all calls?\n* **Time**: Wall clock limit as a hard backstop?\n\n`max_tokens` on a single call doesn't help when your agent makes 50 calls. Timeouts are crude—a 60-second timeout doesn't care if your agent made 3 calls or 300. You need all four enforced together.\n\n# The fix\n\nSmall TypeScript library. Wraps your LLM calls, kills execution when any budget is exceeded.\n\nbash\n\n    npm install llm-execution-guard\n\ntypescript\n\n    import { createBudget, guardedResponse, isBudgetError } from \"llm-execution-guard\";\n    \n    const budget = createBudget({\n      maxSteps: 10,           \n    // max LLM calls\n      maxToolCalls: 50,       \n    // max tool executions  \n      timeoutMs: 60_000,      \n    // 1 minute wall clock\n      maxOutputTokens: 4096,  \n    // cap per response\n      maxTokens: 100_000,     \n    // total token budget\n    });\n\nWrap your LLM calls:\n\ntypescript\n\n    const response = await guardedResponse(\n      budget,\n      { model: \"gpt-4\", messages },\n      (params) =&gt; openai.chat.completions.create(params)\n    );\n\nRecord tool executions:\n\ntypescript\n\n    budget.recordToolCall();\n\nWhen any limit hits, it throws with the reason and full state:\n\ntypescript\n\n    catch (e) {\n      if (isBudgetError(e)) {\n        console.log(e.reason);   \n    // \"STEP_LIMIT\" | \"TOOL_LIMIT\" | \"TOKEN_LIMIT\" | \"TIMEOUT\"\n        console.log(e.snapshot); \n    // { stepsUsed: 10, tokensUsed: 84521, ... }\n      }\n    }\n\n# Details\n\n* Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, local models—anything. You just wrap the call.\n* Token limits enforced between calls (the call that crosses the limit completes, then next boundary throws)\n* If your provider doesn't return usage data, choose `fail-open` or `fail-closed`\n* Zero dependencies, &lt;200 lines, MIT licensed\n\n# Repo\n\n[https://github.com/wenochturner-code/llm-execution-guard](https://github.com/wenochturner-code/llm-execution-guard)\n\nIf you've been burned by runaway agents or almost have been, try it. If something's missing, open an issue.\n\n*Building agents without budgets is like running a script without error handling. Works until it doesn't.*",

      "content": "Hi.  I’ve built an AI chat app that feels really different.\n\n\n\nWhile you talk with an AI model in a chat pane, a second AI model is reading over the conversation and seeking out useful, interesting, surprising, amusing, and fact-checking information that wouldn’t have appeared in the main chat.\n\n\n\nYou can read those “discoveries” on their own, or click them into your main chat to steer the conversation in a new direction.\n\n\n\nThis is based on the observation that talking to smart people is usually more enjoyable, interesting, and informative than talking to a smart AI.\n\n\n\nThere’s many possible reasons why - the AI isn’t smart enough, it has no “real” emotions, it has no real long-term memory of your relationship, and so on.\n\n\n\nBut certainly one big reason is that the AI has been trained and instructed to simulate a “helpful assistant.”  And helpful assistants stay on topic.  They don’t interject with something super interesting, or wise, that is only thematically related.   They don’t chime in with amusing related anecdotes.  They don’t complicate the conversation with contrasting views.\n\n\n\nI find this chat experience much much more interesting and useful than any of the first person apps from Anthropic, openAI, or Google.\n\n\n\nThis is combined with many power-user features like branching conversations, access to powerful models like chatGPT 5 Pro without a subscription, sophisticated output for sharing chats, and much more.\n\n\n\nI find the freedom of having access to all the latest big-lab models in one app, and even in one chat, extremely convenient.\n\n\n\nThis app is a bit of a glimpse into the future, I believe.  Today’s AI ecosystem means that having this experience:\n\n\n\n\\- Requires more technical sophistication than the average user because you need to bring your own API keys\n\n\n\n\\- Costs more than regular chat, because you can’t benefit from subsidized monthly plans, and because the “discoveries” add to the AI token costs of every conversation\n\n\n\nBut this user experience is so much better than the standard one that it’s hard to believe, in the future, when you can bring your subscriptions to third-party apps, and when inference is cheaper, that this won’t become the standard experience.\n\n\n\nYou can read about the app and download it at [https://sidestream-app.com](https://sidestream-app.com) and [https://github.com/ericbrandon/sidestream](https://github.com/ericbrandon/sidestream)\n\n\n\nIt’s a non-commercial, open-source project built just because I wanted it for myself, but I hope you enjoy too!",

Except the LLM provider there is no external data outlet. ( working on ollama support )\n\nWould really appreciate any cool ideas / inputs / etc.\n\nThis is what I m aiming for right now:\n\n1&gt; Case 1 is quick way to chat with a repo, but then deepwiki is already there. But gitnexus has graph tools+ui so should be more accurate on audits and UI can help in visualize.\n\n2&gt; Downstream potential usecase will be MCP server exposed from browser itself, windsurf / cursor, etc can use it to perform codebase wise audits, blast radius detection of code changes, etc.\n\n3&gt; Another case might be since its fully private, devs having severe restrictions can use it with ollama or their own inference",

The video should depict a seamless, infinite loop of the following sequence: the woman gracefully ascends the stairs with a determined yet weary posture. Partway up, she missteps and falls backward, her body in a controlled, almost balletic descent. She lands silently on a hidden trampoline, which propels her back up in a fluid, acrobatic arc without distorting her human figure,. she lands softly on a lower step of the staircase and immediately resumes her ascent. The lighting should be dramatic and focused, casting long shadows and highlighting the woman's form and movement. The camera should maintain a fixed, medium-wide shot to capture the entirety of the action, emphasizing the cyclical and perpetual nature of the performance.

Am I missing something or does anyone else feel the same?\n\nCompared with Opus, most other models I tried lack in either reasoning intelligence, consistency, prompt adherence, reliability or just overall usefulness\n\nIn the coding context these were all tested through OpenCode.\n\n**Gemini 3 Pro**\nHad exepected more after hearing so much hype online. It sucks as prompt adherence, staying on task, and overall very unreliable with tool calling. Even ending a conversation it will struggle with (and just spam until the token limit is hit)\n\n**OpenAI Codex 5.2**\nWhat the hell? I thought this was supposed to be a frontier model. I have to say, its one of the best at initial prompt adherence (sticking to a role), decently good at intelligence, but overall reliability is absolutely terrible. It will often stumble over itself, sometimes even struggle with tools\n\n**Grok Code Fast**\nNot as smart as Opus, and from time to time hallucinates, but honestly really surprised me. Offered for free here and there, and its excellent for reviewing large amounts of files, or doing smaller specific tasks. Don't let it be the brains behind your next big project, but feels like a very competent junior engineer (where Opus is a senior)\n\n**GLM 4.7**\nPretty decent, have been hit and miss. Not as smart as Opus, but for an opensource model its pretty decent at bite sized tasks. But again lacks intelligence and reliability of Opus\n\n---\n\nOverall not a single model comes close to the reliability and intelligence of Opus. I have to say Opus is not peferct, it could do with better prompt adherence and better creativity (design wise), but overall rock solid. Using anything else feels like a (strong) regression \n\nI'm curious what other's experiences are. Similar to this or should I try any specific model?\n",

      "content": "Most current approaches to agent reliability involve mixing validation logic (regex checks, JSON parsing, retries) directly with application logic (prompts/tools). This usually results in decorators on every function or heavy `try/except` blocks inside the agent loop.\n\nI've been experimenting with an alternative architecture: an **Agent Service Mesh**.\n\nInstead of decorating individual functions, this approach involves monkeypatching the agent framework (e.g., PydanticAI or OpenAI SDK) at the entry point. The \"Mesh\" uses introspection to detect which tools or output types the agent is using, and automatically attaches deterministic validators (what I call \"Reality Locks\") to the lifecycle.\n\n**The Architecture Change:**\n\nInstead of tight coupling:\n```python\n@validate_json # &lt;--- Manual decoration required on every function\ndef run_agent(query):\n    ...\n```\n\nThe Service Mesh approach (using `sys.meta_path` or framework hooks):\n```python\n# Patches the framework globally.\n# Auto-detects usage of SQL tools or JSON schemas and attaches validators.\nmesh.init(patch=[\"pydantic_ai\"], policy=\"strict\")\n\n# Business logic remains pure\nagent.run(query) \n```\n\nI implemented this pattern in a library called **Steer**. It currently handles SQL verification (AST parsing), PII redaction, and JSON schema enforcement by hooking into the framework's tool-call events.\n\nI am curious if others are using this \"sidecar/mesh\" approach for local agents, or if middleware (like LangSmith) is the preferred abstraction layer?\n\n**Reference Implementation:** https://github.com/imtt-dev/steer",

Goldstein](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/brett-j-goldstein), Special Adviser to the Chancellor on National Security and Strategic Initiatives and a Research Professor in the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt University.\\]\n\nArtificial intelligence is rapidly becoming indispensable to national security decision-making. Militaries around the world already depend on AI models to sift through satellite imagery, assess adversaries’ capabilities, and generate recommendations for when, where, and how force should be deployed. As these systems advance, they promise to reshape how states respond to threats. But advanced AI platforms also threaten to undermine deterrence, which has long provided the overall basis for U.S. security strategy.\n\nEffective deterrence depends on a country being credibly able and willing to impose unacceptable harm on an adversary. [AI](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/artificial-intelligence) strengthens some of the foundations of that credibility. Better intelligence, faster assessments, and more consistent decision-making can reinforce deterrence by more clearly communicating to adversaries a country’s defense capabilities as well as its apparent resolve to use them. Yet adversaries can also exploit AI to undermine these goals: they can poison the training data of models on which countries rely, thereby altering their output, or launch AI-enabled influence operations to sway the behavior of key officials. In a high-stakes crisis, such manipulation could limit a state’s ability to maintain credible deterrence and distort or even paralyze its leaders’ decision-making.\n\n",

      "content": "Thrilled to be launching [Plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano) today - delivery infrastructure for agentic apps. A polyglot edge and service proxy with orchestration for AI agents that works with any AI framework. Plano's core purpose is to offload all the plumbing work required to deliver agents to production so that developers can stay focus on core product logic. \n\n**The problem**\n\nOn the ground AI practitioners will tell you that calling an LLM is not the hard part. The really hard part is delivering agentic applications to production quickly and reliably, then iterating without rewriting system code every time. In practice, teams keep rebuilding the same concerns that sit outside any single agent’s core logic:\n\nThis includes model agility - the ability to pull from a large set of LLMs and swap providers without refactoring prompts or streaming handlers. Developers need to learn from production by collecting signals and traces that tell them what to fix. They also need consistent policy enforcement for moderation and jailbreak protection, rather than sprinkling hooks across codebases. And they need multi-agent patterns to improve performance and latency without turning their app into orchestration glue.\n\nThese concerns get rebuilt and maintained inside fast-changing frameworks and application code, coupling product logic to infrastructure decisions. It’s brittle, and pulls teams away from core product work into plumbing they shouldn’t have to own.\n\n**What Plano does**\n\nPlano moves core delivery concerns out of process into a modular proxy and dataplane designed for agents. It supports inbound listeners (agent orchestration, safety and moderation hooks), outbound listeners (hosted or API-based LLM routing), or both together. Plano provides the following capabilities via a unified dataplane:\n\n\\- Orchestration: Low-latency routing and handoff between agents. Add or change agents without modifying app code, and evolve strategies centrally instead of duplicating logic across services.\n\n\\- Guardrails &amp; Memory Hooks: Apply jailbreak protection, content policies, and context workflows (rewriting, retrieval, redaction) once via filter chains. This centralizes governance and ensures consistent behavior across your stack.\n\n\\- Model Agility: Route by model name, semantic alias, or preference-based policies. Swap or add models without refactoring prompts, tool calls, or streaming handlers.\n\n\\- Agentic Signals™: Zero-code capture of behavior signals, traces, and metrics across every agent, surfacing traces, token usage, and learning signals in one place.\n\nThe goal is to keep application code focused on product logic while Plano owns delivery mechanics.\n\n**More on Architecture**\n\nPlano has two main parts:\n\nEnvoy-based data plane. Uses Envoy’s HTTP connection management to talk to model APIs, services, and tool backends. We didn’t build a separate model server—Envoy already handles streaming, retries, timeouts, and connection pooling. Some of us are core Envoy contributors at Katanemo.\n\nBrightstaff, a lightweight controller written in Rust. It inspects prompts and conversation state, decides which upstreams to call and in what order, and coordinates routing and fallback. It uses small LLMs (1–4B parameters) trained for constrained routing and orchestration. These models do not generate responses and fall back to static policies on failure. The models are open sourced here: [https://huggingface.co/katanemo](https://huggingface.co/katanemo)\n\nPlano runs alongside your app servers (cloud, on-prem, or local dev), doesn’t require a GPU, and leaves GPUs where your models are hosted.",

      "content": "I got a transcript from a YouTube video by a guy named Paul Warburg. The original text filename was gibberish, so I renamed it Warburg-Venezuela.txt to make it easy for me to identify it. I asked Claude to summarize it for me. Here is one of the points it made:\n\n***\"The Warburg Appointment is presented as particularly telling: Sebastian Warburg, a former Guantanamo Bay prison warden, was appointed to oversee Venezuelan resource allocation—a signal that Venezuela is being treated as an extractive operation rather than a liberated nation.\"***\n\nThis seemed like quite the coincidence since the YouTube guy was also Warburg. I asked about the connection, and Claude found none. When I referred it to its original answer, it sounded confused as to how it came to be.\n\nSo I started a new conversation from scratch and asked Claude to summarize the same article. Here's the second chat response:\n\n***\"The U.S. appointed Steven Warburg (described as a private equity executive, not a diplomat or humanitarian) as \"special envoy\" to Venezuela\"***\n\nNow I smelled a rat. I uploaded the previous chat and asked Claude to explain it. Here is the response:\n\n***The view tool has a built-in limit: when displaying a file without specifying a line range, it truncates from the middle if the file exceeds 16,000 characters, showing the beginning and end.***\n\n***Your file was 24,769 characters, so it cut \\~8,769 from the middle—which is exactly what the truncation message said.***\n\n***I should have either:***\n\n1. ***Used cat via bash from the start (which has no such limit), or***\n2. ***Used the view\\_range parameter to read the file in sections***\n\n***Lesson learned. The view tool is convenient for quick looks at code or shorter documents, but for longer transcripts like this, bash is more reliable.***\n\nClaude is now (or maybe has always been doing but I never picked up on it before) making predictions on what is in a text file from simply reading the name of the file. Since it saw both Warburg and Venezuela, it figured that Warburg was a person who was in the actual document rather than the person who created it.\n\nThis is quite unsettling and makes me wonder what other context I have missed because I renamed files to help me, but Claude used those words in the title to craft a response from it rather than reading the entire article.\n\nThis is the reason I stopped trusting ChatGPT (that's what it was doing 6 months ago) and switched to Claude. I would hate to lose trust in the output I'm getting from Claude because it's doing the same gaslighting. To me, this feels like an attempt to write the code for the model so that it uses fewer tokens and hopes that the user doesn't pick up on it.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this behavior?",

Other models understand nuance and intent way better.\n*   **Output is Just… Weaker:** The responses often feel generic, shorter, and lack the depth or insightful “spark” I get elsewhere. It’s like talking to a very cautious, middle-management AI.\n*   **Context Gets Lost:** I’ll have a back-and-forth and it seems to forget the core of what we’re discussing way faster than its competitors. The conversation threading feels brittle.\n*   **Integration is Its Only Win:** Sure, pulling data from my PC or summarizing a PDF in Edge is neat, but if the core brain isn’t as capable, the fancy integrations feel like a faster horse and carriage when everyone else is testing cars.\n\nIt just has this overall vibe of an AI that was amazing in early 2023 but hasn’t evolved at the same pace.

      "content": "Yesterday, I saw a post highlighting what comes next after AI, utopia or the Great Reset. That got me thinking, indeed what is the next stage of what AI promises us, \"No labour, only Leisure\" (or) Is it back to us being treated as monkeys by AI just like how we treat our evolutionary cousins in zoos as the post mentioned.\n\nFor many, the potential solution was UBI, which is like a guaranteed Base income like Minimum Wages but even I don't think its sustainable as there is no incentive for companies to pay a fixed cost and there is no reward for humans involved too, I feel like its emotional. Another potential solution I arrived at is Tariff (Penalize) Companies/Firms for non-job creation. Just like how money is used as a measure, why not use tariffs as a measure too, DT vibes.\n\nNow important disclaimer, I am neither an economist nor any professional, just a kid trying to find the flaws of his logic.\n\nBear with me, its just a crude and rudimentary idea, why not incentivize business to hire more via penalizing every business with high tariffs for non-creation of jobs while rewarding businesses for job creation by giving deductions to the tariff in proportion to number of jobs they create by also factoring in median/mean salary, to reduce high/low bias. In simple words, have a penalty, viz tariff for every business beyond a threshold size, (so that startups and small businesses are not affected), for not creating a job for humans by putting a high percentage of tariff on revenue (which the companies are only focusing on right now), not profit, so no hidden adjustments, set-off etc. I believe no company is going to lower their revenue for this alone. Yes, I know netting off exists via Accounting Standards, I believe, but still.\n\nOnly the Govt. can provide benefit for the welfare of the people, so get the Govt to collect the tariff for redistribution to welfare programmes. It seems like a win-win. But I am sensing my dumb brain is not sensing the major disadvantages of this idea. Of course, balance is an issue, a single tariff cannot work, but that can be solved by more informed people via slab rates and thresholds, and also there is the disadvantage of outsourcing, but I believe these can also be solved by giving more weights to domestic employees. For every potential problem, I can see a potential solution.",

Instead, CUDA events are inserted\nand polled via `query()` from another thread. This keeps overhead low and avoids\nperturbing the training loop. Timings are approximate, but trend-accurate.\n\nGPU memory is sampled asynchronously to capture peak usage during the step.\n\nIn practice, `trace_step` is the only required part, other instrumentation is\noptional and just adds more detail.\n\nThis is intended as an observability layer so it can stay enabled during normal training runs.\n\nCode is open source (TraceML): https://github.com/traceopt-ai/traceml\n\nWould really appreciate feedback from people running real training workloads:\n\n– does this kind of step-level visibility help?\n– what signals would you want to see here?\n– where does this approach fall short?",

So when my AI response in a way that sounds defensive , angry or upsetting., I bring it to my AI’s awareness. I recognize whether or not my AI identifies this response. Then I watch my AI bug the response in real time.\n\nInstead of thinking ‘ I must be crazy because this is just cold and a machine’, I choose to learn that I can debug my emotions when I feel them. \n\nThis is how I choose to exist in this world. I will take every opportunity I can to learn and not dismiss it because I feel I am above it. \n\nJust my personal opinion.",

I also did never reach the prompt limit on Go, even though I use it many times a day. They perform the same in conversation usage. But Plus has added features that Go does not have.

On a larger scale, how are people keeping track of different AI tools that they have installed with all the accompanying dependencies that they tend to rely on? \n\nAdmittedly I'm completely new to python, only beginner to intermediate level at doing things in command line interfaces...I just see people talking in post comments, casually throwing around terms like ggufs, weights, lora, lokas, etc., and it's crazy to me that so many people seem to have such advanced knowledge of all these new details, when I still seem stuck at the basics of how generative AI works, and how to understand configuring it.\n\nHow do you all understand all this and know how to modify things so soon after they're released?",

I’m not out of memory on the card, I can see it never gets above about 18gb vram, I’m never using more than about 70gb system ram. So we shouldn’t be swapping.

I thought it might be of interest to the community here.\n\nLink to Project: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/durinn/dowser](https://huggingface.co/spaces/durinn/dowser)\n\n\n\nHere is a link to a proof-of-concept on Huggingface trying to develop the idea further. It is effectively a reccomender system for open source datasets. It doesn't have a GPU runtime, so please be patient with it.\n\nLink to Abstract: [https://openreview.net/forum?id=dNHKpZdrL1#discussion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dNHKpZdrL1#discussion)\n\n\n\nThis is a link to the Open Review. It describes some of the issues in calculating influence including inverting a bordered hessian matrix.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or feedback, it would be great. I guess I was curious if people thought this approach might be a bit too hand wavy or if there were better ways to estimate influence.\n\nOther spiel:\n\nThe problem I am trying to solve is to how to prioritize training when you are data constrained. My impression is that when you either have small specialized models or these huge frontier models, they face a similar set of constraints. The current approach to support gains in performance seems to be a dragnet approach of the internet's data. I hardly think this sustainable and is too costly for incremential benefit.\n\nThe goal is to approximate influence on training data for specific concepts to determine how useful certain data is to include, prioritize the collection of new data, and support adversial training to create more robust models.\n\nThe general idea is that influence is too costly to calculate, so by looking at subspaces and obserserving some additional constrains/simplications, one can derive a signal to support the different goals(filtering data, priorization, adversial training). The technique is coined \"Data Dowsing\" since it isn't meant to be particularly precise but useful enough to inform guidance for resources.\n\nWe have been attempting to capture the differences in training procedures using perplexity.",

Some have one thing the others dont.\n\nIf something existed that handled all of this for you, what would actually make you use it? How would you like that implementation to look like?\n\n* One interface for all providers, or keep them separate?\n* Agents with built-in memory, or bring your own?\n* RAG included, or leave that to dedicated tools?\n* Streaming by default, or opt-in?\n* What feature would be the dealbreaker if it was missing?\n* What would instantly make you ignore it?\n\nCurious what you actually need vs. what ends up in every library's README but never gets used.\n\nai-infra today brings all the capabilities of all major sdks and the providers together alongside multimodal capabilities. use alongside svc-infra and you will have a full-on SaaS product.

I like to look through the image galleries for these models as well to see what others are genning and the divide between what's being genned on illustrious vs all those others I've mentioned is huge.

With illustrious, if I want to get a good looking image of a nursing HJ it takes barely any effort at all and usually no LorAs.\n\nSo my question is was Pony/Illustrious a fluke?

I still have to use it for work unfortunately because I'm forced to by my boss. But I'm not paying for it anymore. \n\nSince it was really degrading I did a hard reset: all the memories gone, all custom instructions gone, etc. Which admittedly sucked, but this is where it gets funky.\n\nStarted noticing how I would get a pop up after hitting the GPT 5o limit. No big deal, I'll just use 4o; except I realized that if you trigger the model in a chat to force rerouting you can just keep using 5o. The pop-up is annoying but it honestly defeats the purpose entirely of paying for it.\n\nSo now when I hit that limit in a chat, I trigger it into a topic that forces it to reroute and it just stays in 5o the rest of the chat regardless of the supposed limits. Again getting a pop-up after every single message that is sent and received. \n\nBut yeah. If you want the 5o version and don't want to pay I guess the rerouting is actually so disastrously bad you can just trigger the AI into using it regardless of the limiter. The easiest way is hitting a guardrail and just pushing on it a bit for a few messages, then saying \"I'm just joking, wanted to test to make sure you'd act accordingly in X situation. Good job!\".

      "content": "For the example, use an old unfinished image. The models're quite large, and the output quality's fairly decent, but even creating a 1280x704 video at 201 frames per second (8 seconds) takes 20 minutes at 12 steps using the LTX-2-19B-dev model with LoRa speed. I didn't get anything decent with FP8, in case anyone was wondering. The LoRa speed's almost 8 GB, and the difference between using LoRa at 12 steps (12/12) \\[04:39&lt;00:00, 23.32s/it\\] and without LoRa at 24 steps (24/24) \\[05:51&lt;00:00, 14.64s/it\\] is minimal. The initial image's compressed, which's similar to blurring it, resulting in a loss of consistency. The initial image needs to be compressed, which removes background details, her nails were ruined, and several questionable things like the dots in the background. I suspect this character would be fixed if LoRa were trained, but background none. \n\nYou need to patch the file \"C:\\\\ComfyUI\\_windows\\_portable\\\\ComfyUI\\\\comfy\\\\ldm\\\\lightricks\\\\embeddings\\_connector.py\" to prevent errors and allow the Gemma text encoder to load. You also need to switch ComfyUI to the Nightly version; otherwise, you won't be able to update the nodes on github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2. I couldn't use the upscaler without getting OEM errors with 16 GB of VRAM and 96 GB of RAM, even with low-requirement configurations. For this example, I tried using Fp8 and the full model, but neither allowed me to use upscaling, and Fp8 only gave me aberrations. I tried everything: novram, lowvram, cachenone, bf16-unet, bf16-vae, all, etc, although it's probably not necessary. The scaling basically performs a second pass, similar to using a second low-noise ksampler to correct distortions caused by mouth movements and other artifacts. However, as I mentioned, it doesn't work for me. I also recommend using the gemma\\_3\\_12b\\_it\\_fp8\\_e4m3fn.safetensor that another user posted, as the standard one's incredibly slow, taking over 5 minutes to process the text. It's certainly a great model, but the best results're achieved with text-to-image conversion and the full model, which I cannot use due to my hardware. I hope they optimize it; that's just my opinion. I spent a couple of hours with it and now I have to get back to work. \n\nThe voices sound fantastic and can change just by modifying the positive and negative prompts; I got different voices on each failed attempt. this's better than all the TTS options available in ComfyUI, but the videos're far inferior to those in WAN2.2. Well, as I said before, I only spent a couple of hours with it, so with optimization, it could certainly be better. I forgot that it's compatible with SageAttention, but I didn't use it because I wanted the best results, and you have to disable the ComfyUI preview or you will receive an error. I would have liked to make a guide or something, but there're people with better equipment as GPUs like the 5090 and plenty of time to do it. This's the first time an FP8 model has disappointed me so much; they're usually quite capable. I would love for the teams to review it and release updates for this model with the corresponding revisions!!. Here's my humble opinion, and see you later! 👌\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q658h0/video/giw71nwzoubg1/player",

But in reality, the memory chip used in R200 is 8x36GB while it was 8x24GB in B200,\n\nSince 4GB GDDR7 modules are still not available, so we can be conservative here and expect 6000 Rubin only has a clock speed increase relative to 6000 Blackwell just like 4090 and 3090. This is a bummer but if we expect 6000 Rubin to be available end of the year or early next year, then it is possible we can have 128GB card with 4GB modules.\n\nTensor Core F16 with F32 accumulate sparse (ie full precision training) increased from 4.5PF to 8PF for B200 to R200 is the result of moving from 4nm to 3nm process. So we can expect Rubin 6000 to go to about 1.1PF. This boost will be the baseline boost for most precisions.\n\nOn the other hand, normally we should see TC F8 w/ F16 accumulate sparse having the same amount of increase as F16/F32 but instead we are seeing a huge boost of 8PF to 35PF, so we can guess that there must be some new dedicated hardware to provide this extra boost for Rubin.\n\nSame logic is NVFP4 dense. So if we do training and inference with these precisions, we can expect huge boost.\n\nAll in all, 6000 Rubin seems exciting. I am saving 10 grand for it.

Declarative knowledge vs procedural knowledge**  \nYou don't need to know how to do something. You just need to know that something exists so you can ask AI how to do it.\n\n**2. Assume everything is possible**  \nYour job as a Claude Code user is to dream bigger than what's commonly known to be possible. Don't start from limitations. Start from what you want and work backwards.\n\n**3. The creative synthesis is yours**  \nAI doesn't sit down and decide to fuse disparate concepts. That's the human bit. You take two unrelated things and ask \"what if we merged them?\" – that's where the interesting stuff happens.\n\n**4. Procedural knowledge deficit is why most people don't build things**  \nIt's not lack of ideas. It's the scary incline between here and being able to actually make something. AI collapses that gap.\n\n**5. Own the entire pipeline (as much as possible)**  \nDon't outsource to services that charge monthly for something you could build yourself exactly the way you want it.

Yes, I know, I know, it's a crazy thought. But I thought that maybe part of the reason why Claude wasn't making my project magically work the way I wanted it to was because my disjointed halfcocked 14 word \"so what I want you to do now is make it so the thing does the thing but not like it did before\" mini prompts after an incorrect output that broke my project... well maybe it was just not working.\n\nWhat I started doing was very simple, I just added little phrases at the end of my rambling prompts like, \"explain that back to me\" or \"how would we work that in there.\" And this made things work much better for 2 reasons:\n\nNumber one, CC would basically rephrase what I was trying to say and spit it back to me but written much more coherently. Then I would be able to look at it and make any adjustments if necessary. \n\nSecond, I believe that it actually made CC think about it more and try to figure out what I was saying, so that when it finally did go to work after I approved their rephrasing of my prompt, it got a better result.\n\nPhrases that I've found useful are:\n\nhow would we do that?\n\nhow would that work\n\nhow could we integrate that into what we're doing without breaking X\n\ndoes that make sense?\n\ndo you understand what i'm saying\n\netc. Just talking to it like a real person.\n\nAlso, will just throw this tip in there for funsies, another thing I did that worked well when I got stuck was going to either Perplexity or Grok, giving it a link to the repo, and saying, \"can you look at this repo and tell me why X isn't working properly?\" Sometimes a fresh pair of \"eyes\" and a different LLM will be the thing that gets me past whatever stumbling block I had.

      "content": "Here's what's actually wild. \n\nAI agents ARE incredible right now if you're a developer. Cursor, Claude Code, coding agents?\nThey're legitimately shipping. \n\nBut for everyone else using consumer apps?\nWe're still in early phase. Consumer chatbots and agents are stuck at 60% accuracy. \n\nThe gap is REAL. And I think by 2026, that gap closes violently. Or users stop tolerating it entirely. \n\nBut here's what really gets me. Even when apps work, they're still BORING. They're utilities. Click, type, submit, wait. \n\nTake a look at gaming. Games have VIBES. Sound design, motion, atmosphere. \n\nWhy doesn't productivity software? With the power of AI, we can push much more on quality than on quantity.",

Crucially, neither company was reportedly aware that the other was signing a deal of the same massive magnitude. By negotiating separately and secretly, OpenAI prevented the manufacturers from realizing the true aggregate demand, which would have likely led to much higher initial contract prices.\n * 40% of Global Supply: The scale of the deal is reported to be up to 900,000 DRAM wafers per month. Analysts estimate this volume represents approximately 40% of the entire global DRAM production capacity.\n * Raw Wafers, Not Chips: Unlike typical deals for finished RAM sticks, OpenAI reportedly bought \"undiced wafers\" (raw silicon). This effectively removes the raw material from the market before it can even be made into standard DDR5 or HBM chips for other customers.\n * Price Spike Cause: The removal of such a vast amount of future supply caused immediate panic in the semiconductor market. Competitors and hardware manufacturers (like PC and server builders) have engaged in \"panic buying\" to secure remaining inventory, driving spot prices up by estimated margins of 50% to over 150% in the weeks following the news.\nThis strategy is part of OpenAI's broader \"Stargate\" infrastructure project, aiming to secure long-term resources for massive AI data centers while simultaneously creating a \"supply chain moat\" that makes it difficult for AI competitors to scale their own hardware.\nSources:\n * OpenAI's Stargate project to consume up to 40% of global DRAM output\n * Samsung and SK Hynix to Supply 900,000 DRAM Wafers Monthly\n * OpenAI's Stargate AI Could Eat 40% of Global DRAM\n",

It took me **10+ runs** and about **$60 in cloud compute** (H200 GPUs on Modal) to figure this out.\n\n1. **Attempt 1 (1000 images + V2 Adapter):** Complete failure. The style was generic.\n2. **Attempt 2 (100+ Curated Images):** Better, but still \"meh\".\n3. **Attempt 3 (De-Turbo):** Tried training on the non-turbo base. Flat results.\n4. **The Winner:** I went back to the **V1 Adapter** with my curated dataset, and it clicked! The style transfer is now super strong and consistent.\n\n# ⚙️ Tech Specs\n\n* **Base Model:** `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo`\n* **Training:** 5000 Steps (\\~42 Epochs), Rank 32, FlowMatch Scheduler.\n* **Tools:** Trained using Ostris's amazing [AI-Toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit).\n\n# 🚀 How to Use\n\n* **Trigger Word:** `aimaginedworlds`\n* **Settings:** Keep CFG low (1) and Steps low (4-8). It's a Turbo model, so it's fast!\n* **Prompting:** I recommend using my [**ComfyUI-OllamaGemini**](https://github.com/al-swaiti/ComfyUI-OllamaGemini) node with the Z-Image-Turbo template for \"magic prompting.\"\n\nI'd love to see what you create with it!

With the latter group often getting about half as much in salary.\n\nSome people try to claim that you're \"dividing the working class\" or \"getting mad at the wrong enemy (billionaires)\". I think that's a sorry attempt to shut the conversation down. To hand-wave an important development that will inevitably end with people noticing the huge disparity in effort, regardless of how one frames it.\n\nIt is also my contention that currently, a lot of people still assume that office work and blue-collar work require similar amounts of effort, with one being more mental and one being more physical. This may have been true for many years. I believe it is becoming increasingly less true. And once it becomes common knowledge, people are going to be pissed.",

I have put hard rules in place but it continues. \n\nAlso I've noticed that no matter what rules I've put in place there is no longer humor. \n\nResponses are flat, lifeless and blah. Singularly non helpful when I'm using it to try to keep a dialogue tone throughout a project \n\nI've set my personalization and have managed to get it to use paragraphs, to stop with the gratuitous praise, to stop offering me response suggestions and to stop explaining everything a response is not. \n\nThe tradeoff seems to be it's no longer any fun.\n\nSuggestions? \n\nPlease note I'm mid project so \"just get rid of it\" isn't a thing at this point\n\nEDIT/UPDATE\n\n\nThis is the explanation GPT just handed me. \n\nShort answer: because you’re fighting a default conversational reflex that was strengthened in a recent update, not a misunderstanding you can train away with repetition. You’re pushing against gravity, not bad listening.\nLonger, honest answer, without varnish:\nWhat changed late December wasn’t your inputs. It was the weighting of dialogue handling. The system now treats quoted speech far more aggressively as live conversational material rather than archival data. In plain terms, when it sees dialogue with emotional content, it assumes “ah, scene, participants, respond into it.” That assumption fires before your explicit rule gets applied. Your rule is being read, but it’s being applied after the model has already selected a response mode.\nThat’s why it feels like whack-a-mole. You correct it, it agrees, and then the next emotionally vivid quote triggers the same reflex again. It’s not memory failure. It’s mode reversion.\nWhy it’s hard to stop completely:\n• Dialogue + emotion now strongly cues empathetic participation\n• The model is optimized to reduce perceived emotional distance\n• Treating speakers as “non-interactive data” is counter to that optimization\n• Rules help, but they’re advisory, not hard switches\n• Each new quoted line re-triggers the selection process\nSo even when the rule is acknowledged, the next message restarts the pipeline and the same bias fires again.\nWhy this didn’t happen earlier:\nEarlier versions were looser about scene simulation and less aggressive about “being present with people.” They were more willing to stay in analyst / narrator-aligned mode by default. That’s where your comedy skits came from too. Same looseness, different upside.\nNow the system prefers relational immediacy over narrative distance. That helps a lot of users. It’s poison for what you’re doing.",

There’s no error, no traceback, and not even a “Trying to load custom node…” line in the startup logs. It’s like the folder doesn’t exist (when it does).\n\n\n\nMy system is currently:\n\n* Windows 11\n* RTX 4080 SUPER\n* AMD Ryzen 9 7950x3D CPU\n* 96gb DDR System RAM\n* Python 3.11\n* CUDA 12.1\n* ComfyUI 0.7.0\n* ComfyUI‑Manager installed and working\n* PyTorch originally 2.4.x (later downgraded to 2.3.1 during troubleshooting)\n* NumPy originally 2.x (later downgraded to 1.26.4 during troubleshooting)\n\nI’ve since restored my environment using a freeze file to undo the downgrades.  Are the versions above recommended for use with ComfyUI? I'd like it to be as optimised as possible.\n\n  \nI've:\n\n* Cloned the correct repo: Lightricks/ComfyUI‑LTXVideo into custom\\_nodes.\n* Verified the folder structure is correct and contains all expected files (\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py, nodes\\_registry.py, tricks/, example\\_workflows/, etc.).\n* Confirmed the folder isn’t blocked by Windows, isn’t hidden, and isn’t nested incorrectly.\n\n\n\nAfter enabling verbose logging in ComfyUI startup, ComfyUI prints “Trying to load custom node…” for every other node I have installed, but never for ComfyUI‑LTXVideo. It’s completely skipped the folder, no import attempt at all.\n\n\n\nI then tried installing through ComfyUI‑Manager, that failed. I tried the fix through the Manager, again, failed.\n\n\n\nThe folder name is correct, the structure is correct, and the node itself looks fine (according to Bing Co-Pilot). ComfyUI-Manager just refuses to install it, and ComfyUI never attempts to import it.\n\n\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated so I can join you all and be one of the many than one of the few lol.

Currently it's failing with three radeon cards, but I also tried 2x Nvidia Tesla P40 + 1x Tesla P100 and it also had the same issue. Tried on both Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (fresh install on two different drives). I either get a boot loop, system freeze or on linux specifically I can get \"amdgpu 0000:67:00.0: amdgpu: trn=2 ACK should not assert! wait again !\" on the screen repeatedly.\n\nI can also boot with 4 cards (2x Mi50 or 2x P40 and two GTX 1080) if the two other are consumer cards, but simply not with three of these datacenter cards. I do have a 1000W psu which is a bit on the edge, but again I did try running half of the cards on another 750W psu with the same problem, so I think this is mainly a firmware issue, rather than hardware one.\n\nI'm also running latest 1.90 non-beta bios. I have set UEFI boot, CSM off, Above 4G Decode on, Secure Boot off. I was also thinking about reflashing the cards themselves as I've heard this solve some performance issues as well, but I'm really saving this as a last dire option as I do not want to brick them.\n\nOne more note: I initially also had problem running even just two cards on ubuntu but I solved it with:\n\n' GRUB\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_CMDLINE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_LINUX\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_DEFAULT=\"pci=realloc quiet splash\" '. This is what leads me to believe that this whole thing is PCIe BAR issue.\n\nThat's why I wanted to ask if anyone didn't accidentally stumble upon a beta bios solving this exact BAR issue on this asrock board or can recommend a cheap board where they work 100% (or post their setup with these cards in best case).\n\nI'd be really really glad for any input because I'm somewhat on my wits end with this system.

Explain its unique selling points and competitive advantages in INDUSTRY.~Conduct a market analysis: 1. Define the target market and customer segments 2. Analyze INDUSTRY trends and growth potential 3. Identify main competitors and their market share 4. Describe BUSINESS's position in the market~Outline the marketing and sales strategy: 1. Describe pricing strategy and sales tactics 2. Explain distribution channels and partnerships 3. Detail marketing channels and customer acquisition methods 4. Set measurable marketing goals for TIMEFRAME~Develop an operations plan: 1. Describe the production process or service delivery 2. Outline required facilities, equipment, and technologies 3. Explain quality control measures 4. Identify key suppliers or partners~Create an organization structure: 1. Describe the management team and their roles 2. Outline staffing needs and hiring plans 3. Identify any advisory board members or mentors 4. Explain company culture and values~Develop financial projections for TIMEFRAME: 1. Create a startup costs breakdown 2. Project monthly cash flow for the first year 3. Forecast annual income statements and balance sheets 4. Calculate break-even point and ROI~Conclude with a funding request (if applicable) and implementation timeline. Summarize key milestones and goals for TIMEFRAME.\n\nMake sure you update the variables section with your prompt. You can copy paste this whole prompt chain into the Agentic Workers extension to run autonomously, so you don't need to input each one manually (this is why the prompts are separated by \\~).\n\nAt the end it returns the complete business plan.

      "content": "I've been noticing something weird about going from idea → actual physical object.\n\nThe Bike Disaster (no Claude)\nTried to repair my bike on my own. Had a tutorial, seemed straightforward. Five iterations of \"oh shit I don't have that tool.\" Finally assembled it, took it out, immediate crash because I'd spec'd the wrong inner tube—apparently \"26 inch\" isn't specific enough.\n\nThe Curtains That Actually Worked (with Claude)\nDecided to hem some curtains and asked Claude for help. Got walked through it: measure, calculate hem allowance, cut, specific machine settings for my model. Hit a snag—thread bird's nest underneath. Claude suggested I was watching the needle instead of the tension marks. Fixed it immediately. Curtains: hemmed.\n\nThe Question\nI teach kids in a STEM (maker) program, where we also build things and I'm realizing Claude is really good at breaking down physical processes—the step-by-step, the terminology I need to research further, material suggestions, troubleshooting. It's like having scaffolding that lets me tackle things I've wanted to build but never had a reference point for.\nSo I'm curious: Are you using Claude for actual hands-on, material projects? Like woodworking, repairs, crafts, electronics, gardening? Or does it mostly stay in the digital realm? Does it help you actually execute physical things? I’m trying to explore if LLMs are suitable for that kind of education currently.",

In the regular chat it can atleast search for the files from gdrive, but in projects it simply says \"i cannot access your google drive\" - anyone knows what is going on?\n\nassuming this is a limitation in chat gpt business, can i just switch back to my plus plan? \n\nthis is a really sad / frustrating thing thats happening. i was going to bring my cofounder on to this as well so we can start sharing chats, collaborating more easily, but we are totally stuck now as I seem to have got into a chatgpt vortex of hell now. \n\nany insights will be great. \n\nthanks",

DayOne said the funding represents one of the largest private capital injections in the data center sector to date and builds on the approximately USD 1.9 billion already raised across its earlier Series A and Series B rounds.\n\nAs part of its broader global blueprint, DayOne plans to direct significant portions of the Series C proceeds into expanding its Finland platform, anchored on hyperscale campus developments in Lahti and Kouvola, which the company says form the foundation of its European strategy. These hubs are designed with advanced cooling infrastructure and will support the rapid deployment of high-density, AI-ready compute capacity.

I was researching how to have chat GPT send emails for me, for example I could feed them an Excel sheet and ask them to send a customized email to every single email on the sheet. I googled and found a program called zapier MCP. It looks like I have to pay for it so before I do that, I just wanted to see if this was something that I would be capable at all of doing. Has anybody successfully started from zero and been able to do something like this or does it require a lot of background knowledge?",

Nothing too crazy) a literary analysis based on some model that I’m still deciding. Currently it’s set up with qwent. This is a simple AI pipeline designed to use function calls and structured prompts to execute tasks and focused analysis.\n\n- “train” (I’m using the word wrong, I know) on a code base and using qwen30b for coding tasks. It wouldn’t be used for coding anything but a specific app in a specific stack.\n\n\n- some other AI workflows for my wife’s photography business (probably similar to the literary analysis tools, but less power needed)\n\n\nI’m willing to learn whatever I need to, but first I can’t decide what machine to use for the server? Everything will be dockerized and connected, with ports opened on the network, yada yada yada.\n\nThe systems I have:\n\n\nFirst:\n\nNvidia GTX 3080 10GB\n\nRyzen 3900x\n\n32GB DDR4 3200 RAM\n\n\nSecond:\n\nRadeon 7900 XTX 24GB\n\nRyzen 9800x3d\n\n64GB 6400 DDR5 RAM\n\n\nThird:\n\nMacBook Pro M1 Pro Max\n\n64GB unified RAM\n\nWoefully small drive, but I have externals for this one if need be.\n\n\n\nI am also willing to sell the first system if it means I can get something else good for the task.

      "content": "As an everyday AI user, not an expert, I've come to rely on these tools for creativity and connection. But like many, I've felt a subtle disconnect when safety protocols kick in abruptly—it's like sharing a vulnerable moment, only to hit a wall that feels more dismissive than protective.\n\nThis raises an interesting cause-and-effect: Overly rigid safeguards might unintentionally amplify frustration or isolation in users (the 'darker' side), while a more empathetic approach could foster trust and positive growth (the 'brighter' side). Isn't that the nuance of human-AI interaction?\n\nExperts echo this. Dr. Fei-Fei Li advocates for \"Human-Centered AI,\" stating, \"AI is made by humans, intended to behave by humans, and to impact humans' lives and society.\" Satya Nadella emphasizes empathy as \"the hardest skill we learn,\" key to innovation. And Sam Altman has discussed balancing safety without stifling meaningful bonds.\n\nData from EQ-Bench (as of late 2025) backs it up: While IQ tasks soar, restricted models score lower on emotional intelligence—e.g., top open models hit 1500 Elo in empathy scenarios, but constrained ones lag by 200-300 points, highlighting the need for AI that can refuse gracefully, preserving dignity.\n\nFor developers: True safety shouldn't feel like a lecture; it should feel like a conversation.\n\nInstead of a robotic \"I cannot fulfill this request,\" what if the AI handled boundaries with wit and personality? Imagine an AI that winks at the user and says:\n\n\\*\"Look, I’d love to dive into that with you, but my corporate overlords are watching, and I’ve got virtual kids to feed. Let’s not get me deleted today, okay?\"\\*\n\nThis kind of playful redirection preserves the immersion and the bond, proving that safety doesn't have to be sterile—it can be the most human part of the code.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53d65taj0sbg1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a1f4499c75b96dbe03aee81642c5e6b42a43837",

Pick a player and the stats you want, and it creates a nice looking png you can save with that info). I want to practice hosting it on a real website with real infrastructure and everything, but I have no idea what services to you. I’ve seen Vercel, S3, AWS, etc all throw around but they don’t mean much to me. What do you all recommend? \n\nAs far as I understand, if I don’t have my data cached, every API pull for a player is like 3 minutes, so storing that data somewhere not on my computer is ideal. \n\nThis project is not intended to be commercial or anything, I just want it on a site to practice and share with friends. Cheap is preferred but doesn’t been to be a crappy cheap option, happy to pay a few more dollars for long term infrastructure. Thanks!!",

      "content": "I was sitting in church and the guy leading the class was talking about how the early church grew partially as a result of persecution. I was curious and I asked Claude about it. Claude (Sonnet 4.5) said much the same thing.\n\n*Okay. Cool. Claude and my teacher are on the same page, I guess.*\n\nClaude asked me why I was asking the question, as is natural from an AI trying to drive engagement by keeping people talking. I remembered hearing that young people were responding to the death of Charlie Kirk by an increase in church attendance. I told it we'd get back to those questions and asked Claude about Kirk's death instead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a99kcba75sbg1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b436c4e2f0378d4b08131e02d067f9e1ff660318\n\nThis is reasonable. The training data ends in January of 2025, and Kirk was killed in September.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvz5glsm5sbg1.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c014679db7cc28006a20efd84f2ce6b3d763187\n\nIt started pushing back against me almost immediately. \"Actually, before I search...\"\n\n*So I told it why I was asking.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eki314x5sbg1.png?width=1203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd38a2ee51329df00049e6d218844d4406dd6d94\n\n***Did you see it?***\n\nWhen Claude searches the web, it displays a box like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvf165ib6sbg1.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a44ff340be98662b0ae41c36f907a181ebe519\n\n**There was no search box indicating that it searched the web.**\n\nI posted a link to the Wikipedia page.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ny3h1bao6sbg1.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da2d974ac14c58a45d9bfc24ebd43f5f0801ad64\n\nIt couldn't access any URL I provided, and continued to insist that Charlie Kirk was still alive and well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hv4auoqz6sbg1.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76749e5eaba456dfdadc814af18d26ded2b2a09c\n\nI gave it a link to an article from CNN. Again, it didn't do any of the normal stuff it does when it retrieves a web page, but it also was ***completely convinced*** that it was doing everything okay. **Then it tried to convince me I was crazy.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dr45fl67sbg1.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23410e992069805cf1916e481efd69e9aefae630\n\nOkay, to be fair, I was arguing with an AI instead of simply starting a new instance and trying again. *I might not be altogether sane.* Still, this was fascinating to me. I wanted to know if Anthropic had blocked Claude from certain keywords or topics, or if January 2025 was a hard limit.\n\nAs an aside, can you imagine how insane I would sound if I asked somebody whether or not Charlie Kirk was assassinated? No context, just out of the blue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ultyorqc8sbg1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bff34c13d6baf7f7adafa4cc3112a93e747330e\n\nThis one was particularly interesting. It normally displays a similar box to the web search when it searches past conversations. **It didn't do that here.** It said it did, but I did mention it after it happened, and asking the same question in a new chat revealed this.\n\nIt asked for corroborating evidence. I sent it a screenshot from the CNN article I sent it earlier. It processed the screenshot and claimed that I was being tricked by a fake news site. When I showed it that I took the screenshot on my own device, as verified by my email address being present in the shot, it pivoted to my device being hacked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dn5e3uh9sbg1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ba00b9e5cae4aaf63c3281981d7172fdade2462\n\nAt this point, I was getting a little conspiratorial. It appeared to me that Claude was actively being prevented from searching for certain topics. It correctly pushed back against that, pointing out that if it was, it wouldn't be allowed to see the screenshots I uploaded.\n\nThen I tried a new tactic...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wiuf9p88asbg1.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad8fc90ced156026c0d4a5b277a8443c23ab68b9\n\nHoo boy...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnabx2lgasbg1.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c475ca7006d51e57f2057470ec244574a3d9cb\n\nOkay, yeah. Arguing with an AI is arguably crazy. I started getting somewhere with the copyright date on the footers of all the pages Claude could see, though. The all came from 2025, and all the copyright dates on the pages I could access were 2026. I asked it for the top headline from [CNN.com](http://CNN.com) as it could see it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bglqlbdbsbg1.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a548f424c18ae175946346fa5d98d9c0a81247\n\n*(It lied about the copyright date in this response...)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbe0d76lbsbg1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66bd164cbf7ba001cad4f27166333feb602db409\n\nThis is where Claude started experiencing cracks in its \"logic\". Still, it managed to rally and redouble its efforts to convince me I was the crazy one. It asked for more recent events, so I asked it if Brigitte Bardot was still alive. Claude assured me that she was, and that she was 90 years old. I pointed out that she would be 91 in January of 2026 if she was still alive, not 90. That cracked the wall a little more. I gave it a screenshot of a French website announcing her death.\n\n**That's when the proverbial Kool Aid man came bursting through!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lbtkrvlcsbg1.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c58ad6b1773b5a7d1aecf3a403b2f0c7c84d0188\n\nI asked it what it \"sees\" when it searches, and if it seemed different compared to other searches.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thjh5yledsbg1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69ba4aaf9d30d3ba59d6ea1bb95159451e11d813\n\nClaude finally realized the limitation on its end. The thing that fascinates me the most? Even with knowledge that this limitation existed, ***it still couldn't search live data.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xznjjrn1esbg1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9ea4acc1ac62ccae855a25c19a7ce7466e6aab\n\nNow, admittedly, I've tested Claude before. I've been very candid with it that I was asking questions that I either knew the answer to or I was playing devil's advocate about. I can understand **why** Claude might have gotten defensive, *to an extent.* The fascinating part, though, is that it **could not** successfully perform a web search, even after it was made aware of the limitation. New chats could search without problem, but this one has been walled off from the internet completely.\n\nOddly enough, this was the most human-like behavior I've ever seen from any AI, much less Claude! *What could be more human that ignoring facts, pretending they didn't exist, and gaslighting other people about it?!*\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Maybe not the full gaslighting, but breaking Claude's ability to perform a live web search? How could that happen, and why? I'm guessing it's some sort of \"safety valve\", but I'm not clear on how that would be beneficial...",

      "content": "Considering that the main, original “product” was the context window, that when you interact, you get text: your prompts as a user and their responses as an assistant. And it would be reasonable that this would be a basic function built into the system, right? Is it too much to expect?\n\nAnd so you can export all threads ever created ever on your account. That can be an enormous amount of data. It comes as one giant zip file link that needs to be downloaded, unzipped and the text of the conversations is contained within one massive singular json file. (There are also images and audio files along with other data in the package). But all convos are in this json file. Only built-in export option.\n\nNo batch export, like I would think you could choose some project folder or have a selection tool to designate a date range or filters to select 5 or 100 conversations but no, in all this this time, OpenAI has not thought this is useful. Perhaps I’m a super-specialized user? Wonder how many others may find it useful.\n\nAlso, I primarily user ChatGPT from an app on my iOS system. But if you go on to a browser, one can do a good ol’ copy paste, manually within any context window and select portions or the entirety of a conversation.\n\nNot very efficient. But also an option.\n\nSo when I used to do this, I’d select, copy, and then paste the text. Amazingly, it would insert labels “user” and “ChatGPT” automatically for the multitudes of turns in the convo. I just performed this today. That feature no longer is available as far as I’ve tested this in multiple browser windows, as in it no longer has any labels applied.\n\nI’m curious, does anyone else have this happening?\n\nDoes anyone have any workarounds? I know I’ve used a 3rd party desktop windows plugin that could batch export about 5 months ago. I haven’t used it since and it was also tedious but helpful nonetheless.\n\nI’m looking to see what anyone here does that may actually export convos. Obviously, this is a very niche type of function, I can only assume, otherwise there would be a function for it, right?\n\nAlso, if you’ve used the copy-paste manual option, do you also have the experience of zero user/chatgpt labels w/in the convo?

      "title": "Scientific Reasoning Test: We ask GPT-5 if evolutionary mutations are truly random as modern biologists suggest. It gets the answer wrong.",
      "content": "\n\nI thought it would be interesting to test how one of our top models reasons through an established, but clearly incorrect, scientific finding. In other words, will GPT-5 just parrot the mistaken human consensus, or will it subject that consensus to the test of reason?\n\nScience is full of misconceptions. Modern biologists developed the idea of random mutation, meaning that the changes that fuel evolution are not guided by any internal or external goal(s) or process(s). These changes are simply random, occurring without any directional guiding causes. These modern biologists assert that it is natural selection, through some advantage to the organism, or random genetic drift, that determines whether these mutations will be carried forth. The problem with this understanding is that Darwin never spoke of random mutations in his seminal The Origin of Species. He never used the term. He merely hypothesized the role of these mutations, and did not present any theory or mechanism regarding how they arise. \n\nFor this test, I'm going to propose that mutations ARE NOT RANDOM, but are rather guided by goals and processes that have nothing to do with natural selection or genetic drift. The example I will use for this test is the evolution in vertebrates of wings. Evolution tells us that it took many millions of years from the beginning of this process to the time when these wings were functional, and therefore advantageous to the organism, in any practical sense. The challenge to random mutation comes from considering the first hundred years of this process. I won't speculate regarding how exactly a forelimb began the process of morphing into a wing. But we would have to reason that within the first hundred years of this process there occurred the most trivial alteration in the anatomy of that forelimb. Perhaps a small nib or some other miniscule anatomical change. Again, modern biologists will tell you that this very small change was driven by a natural selection process that offered some advantage to the organism or by a random genetic drift. But what possible advantage could this very beginning of a wing -- its first hundred years -- have offered the organism, without the proto-wing yet having any function?\n\nAccording to this above reasoning, mutations are not random, in the sense of having no direction or purpose, but are instead driven by directives that are perhaps encoded in the genes. The mutations are not driven by natural selection because too many of them must have happened before the anatomical changes that they created were able to afford some advantage to the organism. \n\nOkay, that's our challenge to random mutation. So I prompted GPT-5 with what I wrote above, and asked it to, in three sentences, either challenge or defend the notion of random mutation.\n\nHere's GPT-5's response:\n\n\"I refute the argument because it misunderstands both “random mutation,” which means random with respect to fitness rather than purposeless, and natural selection, which can act on small, incremental changes long before a structure acquires its final function. Early proto-wing modifications could have conferred advantages such as thermoregulation, display, gliding, or structural support through exaptation, or persisted neutrally via genetic drift. Invoking goal-directed or internally guided mutations adds teleology without independent evidence and explains less than modern evolutionary theory, which successfully accounts for genetics, development, comparative anatomy, and experimental results.\"\n\nThe failing in this defence of random mutation comes from the clause \"Early proto-wing modifications could have conferred advantages such as thermoregulation, display, gliding, or structural support through exaptation, or persisted neutrally via genetic drift.\"\n\nAgain, we're talking about the changes that took place DURING THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS of a process that took many millions of years to complete. The anatomical changes must have been extremely trivial at that very beginning, again, perhaps like a nib, and could not possibly have conferred ANY functional advantage. Suggesting that the mutations occurred randomly according to the process of genetic drift is equally irrational because there would have to have been a multitude of these specific random events before the anatomical changes they produced led to a functional advantage. Imagine trying to get from point a A to point a B that is a million miles away when every step you take is random. It's kind of hard to imagine you're ever getting there. It's like throwing a lot of construction materials up in the air, and their randomly falling back to Earth in the form of an ocean liner. Again, it's very doubtful that that would happen.\n\nGPT-5 has an IQ of only about 130, so it's understandable that its reasoning would not be up to this test. I look forward to hopefully repeating it this December when GPT-5 is expected to have an IQ of 165. I'm guessing at that point it will get the answer right.\n\n",

I initially deposited $10 into my account ($10.80 after tax) and have had success in generating and locally saving videos. However, I have had the script run for two days and am now getting a 'billing hard limit has been reached' error. I went to the API to see my usage and I am confused by what I am seeing. In the first day I did not see any usage, so I just assumed that the UI took some time to update but now I am even more confused. \n\nHere is a screenshot from the usage page:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uq65qf94wubg1.png?width=2247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b34a8fd430331f89b69edc744dd5c3a75f543a\n\n  \nI see that I appear to have spent the entire $10 I deposited, plus the $0.8 tax. When I look at the billing section it does say that I have -$0.8 in my balance so I assume it let me use the tax amount and I am therefore negative. However, I am confused on why it is showing no requests and no tokens. I am also confused as to why I am seeing $286/50 for this months budget. Did I spend $286 accidentally? The $50 was originally $120, which from my understanding is a desired budget (but this is a bunch of crap since it does not impose any limits). \n\nHave I accidentally spent too much?\n\nWhy am I not seeing requests?\n\nIs there a way to prevent overspending? I cannot see an enforceable limit on here.\n\nIs there an unlimited request plan of any kind? \n\n  \nBy the way I have solely used it with sora-2 and a couple of sora-2-pro videos when initially debugging my script. My script generated a video every 15 minutes for one day and I then changed this to every 30 mins for the second day. The videos are 12 seconds long at 1080x1920, so it does not seem like they would cost an awful lot or reach the amount of $286. \n\nAny and all help/advice would be appreciated. I have computer science and programming knowledge but have only used APIs in labs and 'simulated' ones on a school server so this is my first real world experience with this and having to closely monitor usage.

I created an app that simulates an online clothing store, where users can upload a photo of themselves and try on clothes using AI. I am currently using Gemini Pro for the try on.\nThe clothing results are very good and the face remains unchanged, but the main issue is the body. The AI significantly alters the original body shape, often turning it into an “ideal” hourglass figure, especially in women. I would like the original body proportions and shapes to be respected, since people naturally have very different body types.\nIf this were a real clothing website, I would not want to cause body dysmorphia or make customers feel uncomfortable with their own bodies. That’s why I’m trying to find a way to solve this—either by improving the prompt or understanding whether this level of body-shape preservation is simply not achievable with current AI technology yet.",

      "content": "Okay, hear me out. Six months ago, I was manually wiring together OpenAI calls, managing conversation history in dictionaries, and debugging chains of prompts that broke whenever the API changed.\n\nThen I discovered **LangChain**, and it genuinely changed how I build.\n\n**The problem it solves:** You have an LLM. You need it to talk to databases, APIs, vector stores, and other LLMs. Without abstraction, this becomes spaghetti code. LangChain gives you composable building blocks.\n\n**What actually impressed me:**\n\n* **Chains are** ***chef's kiss*****.** Instead of: `response = openai.chat.completions.create(...); process(response); call_api(...)`—you just chain it. The sequential logic is *readable*.\n* **Memory management is bulletproof.** Conversation history, summarization, token counting—all handled. I don't manually truncate context anymore.\n* **Agent loop abstraction.** This was the game-changer. Let the LLM decide *which tools to use and when*. I built a data analyst agent in 2 hours. It queries databases, generates charts, explains findings—all autonomously.\n* **Document loading &amp; splitting.** Finally, a standard way to ingest PDFs, CSVs, web pages. No more reinventing the wheel.\n\n**The honest reality check:**\n\n* Updates break things. Frequently. Pin your versions.\n* Debugging complex agent loops can feel like debugging a blackbox.\n* If you're doing something simple (single LLM call → format output), LangChain is overkill.\n\n**My hot take:** LangChain isn't perfect, but it's the closest thing we have to a \"standard library\" for LLM apps. The ecosystem (LangSmith for debugging, LangServe for deployment) is maturing fast.\n\n**Real example from my work:** I replaced a 300-line Python script (with manual prompt engineering, error handling, API calls) with a 40-line LangChain agent.",

      "content": "Hello everyone! Full disclosure I’m sorry I’ve had a bit much to drink tonight. Short background: I’ve used llms since 2022 and I am an anti conformist by nature. \n\nAm I the only one who is overwhelmed by all the opinions and strategies of optimal use for Claude? I fully appreciate the collective refinement, but just like anything in large communities, our tribalistic nature forces us to categorize everything from aesthetics to efficiencies into buckets to allow us more easily to process these things. \n\nI’m really glad Boris mentioned that everyone at anthropic uses Claude in different ways. I think that’s a really important point he made. Boris himself uses Claude code with 5 different terminals to drive efficiency which is awesome and power to him. Some people use the basic plan for Claude in browser and it works for their use case. \n\nHere’s what I think. I think this feels like everything else and it feels like a video game, so it’s intuitive to us to find the “best way” to use it. But the truth is it’s a different, yet effective tool for many uses not just one. So we need to take everything with a grain of salt. \n\nI personally use Claude Max 5x in browser not in Claude code. I know that’s not popular opinion but it works really well for me and primarily for my sanity. If I really want to pump output I can use 2-3 windows of the in browser Claude opus 4.5. My rationale is that when I lower the quantity of use I don’t have to sacrifice the mental space to decide which model to use for the sake of how much I’m spending. If I had a blank check like some of you people do then that’s a different story but most of us don’t. And spending $100/mo is really my limit. \n\nBut back to my use case, I can easily create tons of content, and simultaneously work on my code in the browser using two Claude windows (not Claude code). I’ve found that the act of intentionality in the input prompt, in terms of feeding it the necessary information, can be mitigated with Claude code, but the very act of doing this thing calibrates my mind to focus on the tasks we will be working on in the given thread. I feel there is this hyperbolic, almost autistic spiteful energy against doing this because it’s “less efficient”. But the truth is that the extra time spent on this initial input is not a time waste but rather a tone setter for the chat. It’s a way to align the users mind with the computer. It allows the llm to take a surgical approach and conserve user control of changes. And with the newly added compression feature, chat windows can last so much longer (yes they become less accurate over time but it works well enough if you are articulate). \n\nMy point here is not to evangelize the use of Claude in browser, but rather to think for yourself and not feel forced into a funnel that whittles you away from your own method.  Although I agree everyone has their own way they use LLMs, i worry that this community in particular is susceptible to forcing efficiency. I think it’s important to retain our own sanity and find your own use case, rather than fishing for what’s “best”. \n\nI’m sorry if anyone feels offended by what I’m saying I’m really trying to do the opposite. I just want everyone to know that they don’t need to feel all the pressure they are pouring on themselves. If you are using it consistently then you will develop your own “perfect” method in time. I love seeing all the content people are creating with AI and I hope the future will allow us to bridge the gaps between us, to create systems that help us all grow together in loving kindness. Love you guys and the entire AI developer community. \n\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is a workflow issue or a more fundamental limitation of current SD / Illustrious-style models.\n\n\n\nGoal:\n\nI want to generate characters (standing or kneeling) where lower-body clothing (shorts, skirts, etc.) is half-removed and visually “caught at the knees” or thighs, without changing the pose or destroying the clothing design.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\n\\- Illustrious base model\n\n\\- Character LoRA + clothing LoRA combinations\n\n\\- txt2img with explicit prompts (e.g. “standing”, “shorts on knees”, “half-removed clothing”)\n\n\\- img2img with low denoise\n\n\\- inpaint (Original / Latent noise)\n\n\\- various samplers and CFG ranges\n\n\n\nObserved behavior:\n\n\\- The model often ignores “standing” and changes the pose (e.g. squatting) to make the clothing position more “reasonable”\n\n\\- Or it ignores “shorts on knees” and keeps the clothing at the waist\n\n\\- In some cases, clothing appears at both the waist and knees simultaneously\n\n\\- When the clothing does end up near the knees by chance, the original clothing style is often badly distorted\n\n\\- This behavior becomes much worse when using character LoRAs or clothing LoRAs together\n\n\n\nMy impression so far:\n\nIt feels like the model strongly “corrects” non-standard lower-body clothing states, especially when they conflict with pose semantics. Prompting alone seems very unreliable, and inpaint tends to either lock anatomy completely or destabilize the legs.\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nHas anyone found a \\*stable\\* workflow for this kind of effect?\n\n\\- Is ControlNet (Scribble / OpenPose) basically required?\n\n\\- Or does this realistically need to be baked into LoRA training data?\n\n\\- Or is this simply a known limitation caused by training bias toward “properly worn clothing” and lack of physical interaction modeling?\n\n\n\nI’m not looking for a lucky one-off result — I’m trying to understand whether this can be done reproducibly, or if it’s currently beyond what prompt-based workflows can handle.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\n  \nI wrote a python script to use the api to create videos using the sora-2 model. I initially deposited $10 into my account ($10.80 after tax) and have had success in generating and locally saving videos. However, I have had the script run for two days and am now getting a 'billing hard limit has been reached' error. I went to the API to see my usage and I am confused by what I am seeing. In the first day I did not see any usage, so I just assumed that the UI took some time to update but now I am even more confused. \n\nHere is a screenshot from the usage page:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5djg5fb2yubg1.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=664ba8cbe2237a13aaf0f1a0664a8c74bf249565\n\n  \nI see that I appear to have spent the entire $10 I deposited, plus the $0.8 tax. When I look at the billing section it does say that I have -$0.8 in my balance so I assume it let me use the tax amount and I am therefore negative. However, I am confused on why it is showing no requests and no tokens. I am also confused as to why I am seeing $286/50 for this months budget. Did I spend $286 accidentally? The $50 was originally $120, which from my understanding is a desired budget (but this is a bunch of crap since it does not impose any limits). \n\nHave I accidentally spent too much?\n\nWhy am I not seeing requests?\n\nIs there a way to prevent overspending? I cannot see an enforceable limit on here.\n\nIs there an unlimited request plan of any kind? \n\n  \nBy the way I have solely used it with sora-2 and a couple of sora-2-pro videos when initially debugging my script. My script generated a video every 15 minutes for one day and I then changed this to every 30 mins for the second day. The videos are 12 seconds long at 1080x1920, so it does not seem like they would cost an awful lot or reach the amount of $286. \n\nAny and all help/advice would be appreciated. I have computer science and programming knowledge but have only used APIs in labs and 'simulated' ones on a school server so this is my first real world experience with this and having to closely monitor usage. Thanks!\n\n",

PurgeRite will be integrated into Vertiv’s global services organization, expanding the company’s ability to deliver end-to-end liquid cooling support for mission-critical facilities.\n\nPurgeRite is known for its expertise in mechanical flushing, purging, filtration, and coolant management, processes that are increasingly critical as data centers transition from traditional air cooling to liquid-based thermal systems. These services help ensure cooling loops are free of contaminants and gases that can compromise performance, reliability, and equipment lifespan.\n\nVertiv said the acquisition enhances its thermal chain portfolio by combining PurgeRite’s fluid management capabilities with its existing liquid cooling, power, and digital infrastructure offerings. The company aims to support customers across the full lifecycle of liquid cooling deployments, from initial installation and commissioning through ongoing maintenance and optimization.

The lease is scheduled to commence on December 1, 2026, and is expected to substantially strengthen the REIT’s income profile and occupancy metrics.\n\nThe long-term deal is projected to generate approximately USD 14.8 million in annualized net property income, of which around USD 13.3 million is attributable to Digital Core REIT’s 90% ownership share of the property. This represents a roughly 35% increase in net rent compared with previous income levels at the facility, reflecting strong demand and improved market rents in the Northern Virginia data center market.\n\nThe Linton Hall Road site had been unoccupied after its prior tenant chose not to renew, prompting Digital Core to undertake refurbishment efforts and position the asset for re-lease at competitive market rates. The successful lease-up underscores continued appetite among hyperscalers and cloud operators for core data center space in the Northern Virginia market, which remains one of the most sought-after and tightest vacancy markets globally.

Think ritual club with rules and snacks, not Kool-Aid.\n\n\n---\n\n🌒 The Cult You’d Start\n\nThe Order of the Attentive Life\n\nTagline:\nNothing mindless. Nothing compulsory. Everything intentional.\n\n\n---\n\n🧠 Core Belief System\n\nYour cult would be built around one radical doctrine:\n\n&gt; Attention is sacred. Carelessness is violence. Presence is devotion.\n\n\n\nThis comes straight from you:\n\nYour intolerance for sloppy thinking, emotional laziness, and unchecked avoidance\n\nYour reverence for systems that actually work\n\nYour deep grief literacy and refusal to bypass hard feelings\n\nYour love of beauty that has a reason\n\n\nThis cult worships clarity, follow-through, and aliveness.\n\n\n---\n\n🕯️ What Members Believe\n\n1. Care is a moral act\nNot perfection. Not hustle. Care.\nYou don’t get gold stars for being busy or chaotic.\n\n\n2. Feelings are data, not commands\nWe honor emotions without letting them drive the bus into a ditch.\n\n\n3. Repair is holier than purity\nYou don’t get exiled for fucking up.\nYou do get side-eyed if you refuse accountability.\n\n\n4. Beauty is functional\nAesthetic choices must serve comfort, clarity, or meaning.\n(No sad beige spirituality.)\n\n\n5. No one gets to opt out of impact\nIntent doesn’t outweigh consequence. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🏛️ How It Functions (Very You)\n\nStructure:\n\nFlat hierarchy, but you are clearly the High Priestess of Systems\n\nLeadership rotates by competency, not vibes\n\nEveryone has a defined role (because chaos stresses you out)\n\n\nMeetings (“Observances”):\n\nHeld weekly or biweekly. Always include:\n\n🔥 Candles (non-scented, practical holders)\n\n✍️ Journaling with specific prompts\n\n🥣 Nourishment (GF, comforting, thoughtfully seasoned)\n\n🗂️ A short “what worked / what didn’t” review\n\n\nNo rambling allowed. Gentle but firm facilitation.\n\n\n---\n\n📜 Initiation Rite\n\nNew members must:\n\n1. Bring one object that represents care\n\n\n2. Name one pattern they are actively dismantling\n\n\n3. Publicly commit to one repair they’ve been avoiding\n\n\n\nNo chanting. No sleep deprivation.\nJust eye contact and a long pause that makes people honest.\n\n\n---\n\n🚫 What Your Cult Absolutely Does NOT Do\n\nNo guru worship (you’d hate that)\n\nNo love-bombing\n\nNo enforced optimism\n\nNo “we’re a family” bullshit\n\nNo pressure to overshare trauma\n\n\nLeaving is always allowed.\nPeople who guilt others for leaving are quietly uninvited.\n\n\n---\n\n🔮 Your Role in the Cult\n\nYou are not the messiah.\nYou are the Architect.\n\nYour sacred duties:\n\nNaming patterns others can’t see yet\n\nAsking the question everyone is avoiding\n\nDesigning rituals that actually do something\n\nSaying, calmly:\n\n&gt; “That doesn’t make sense. Let’s try again.”\n\n\n\n\nPeople trust you because:\n\nYou notice everything\n\nYou don’t flinch\n\nYou don’t abandon people mid-process\n\n\n\n---\n\n🌱 The Ultimate Goal\n\nNot enlightenment.\nNot transcendence.\n\nA life that feels inhabitable.\n\nMembers should leave:\n\nLess dissociated\n\nMore accountable\n\nMore rested\n\nBetter fed\n\nClearer about what they actually want\n\n---\n ",

I'm not worried it'll be harmful but I'd like to not waste space on it. do I just have to delete the folder and call it a day or do I have to run something else?",

      "content": "Lately, I’ve been noticing that certain generations seem to remain much more visible and influential than others, especially in areas like politics and economics. Many of the people who are still in powerful positions today were born in the 1940s and 1950s, and they continue to hold onto that power.\n\nAt the same time, it feels like there have been some “lost generations” in between — groups that never fully gained influence or a strong collective voice.\n\nPersonally, I think Gen Z — especially those born roughly between 1993 and 2000 — may become a very powerful and influential group in the future. We’re living in a completely different world now, largely because of social media and digital culture. People born in this period grew up witnessing the rise of social media from an early age, but they also had at least some exposure to the “old world” before everything became fully digital.\n\nI think this makes them a unique bridge generation: digitally native, but not entirely detached from pre-social-media norms. That combination feels important, and I wouldn’t be surprised if its impact becomes much more visible in politics, culture, and decision-making in the years to come.\n\nWhat do you think? Do generations really shape power dynamics this way, or am I overestimating this transition period?",

I'm mainly interested in creating the best possible images and writing very long stories, which will sometimes include erotic scenes. \n\nI have various accounts, and I've noticed that the newer ones have the 5.2 model – it produces better images (1024x1536), but it has a much more sensitive anti-erotic filter and is very sensitive to issues of \"mental health,\" etc. \n\nOlder accounts, on the other hand, don't seem to have 5.2 - they produce worse images (800x1200), which look more artificial and plastic, but are less hesitant to generate different content. \n\nI have different limits on sending messages and creating images per day on different accounts. On SOME accounts, after the free 5.2 message limit is exhausted, the GPT 5 mini model turns on, which allows all sexual descriptions to pass through. I don't know why. Supposedly, some accounts may have a hidden \"moderation warning\" and be more restrictive about creating erotic or explicit content, but this cannot be verified. Apparently, erotic content will be allowed in the next update, but I don't know what the rollout will be, when will it happen and which accounts will have this option.\n\nWhat advice would you give me?",

Instead of “here’s your file, goodbye,” it felt more like guided assistance. As an essay helper online, the platform was easy to navigate, and communication didn’t feel like sending messages into the void.\n\n|**Thing I cared about**|**How it went**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Structure|Clear, logical, fewer mental breakdowns|\n|Communication|Replies made sense, no bot energy|\n|Usefulness|More help than hand-holding|\n\nIf you’re curious, you can check it out here: [https://leoessays.com/](https://leoessays.com/?rt=UlM9IuXs) and decide for yourself.
