      "content": "Two videos give state of art of XR at #ces2026. This is my ninth and 10th video report from CES. \n\nBoth were in suites, which means the public couldn't get into see them. \n\nThe first is of @getVITURE, which had the best middle-weight AI glasses. \n\nThe second is of @LumusVision, which makes the glass in the displays of the Meta Rayban Displays (the industry calls them waveguides). It showed me the first that I've seen that have 70 degree field of view. Meta's current glasses have waveguides that can only do about 20 degree field of view. The difference in size of the virtual image you see in front of you is like going from an iPhone to a 100-inch TV on your wall.\n\nThe Viture, along with competitors, @rayneo_global, @RokidGlobal, @XREAL_Global, among others, use a hybrid waveguide and bird bath optic. The bird bath has a much thicker optic in front of your eyes. \n\nIf you actually want to play a video game, or work while say on a flight, the middle weights are the ones you want. The virtual image is like seeing a movie in a movie theater. \n\nThe problems with the bird bath optics are they aren't good to wear in the real world, like while walking around a shopping mall, and need to be plugged into a phone or a laptop to save weight and have enough processing power to put a movie up in front of you. \n\nThat takes us to lightweights. I saw many, and Lumus' 70-degree field of view waveguide will be in lightweights in 2028. And I assume there are competitors that we'll probably see at SPIE (optics show in San Francisco) in a few months. Many of the lightweights, like @EvenRealities, have small green and black displays. I have them and they are quite nice, but I want full color displays for obvious reasons. \n\nApple bought a waveguide company years ago, so I assume it is working on some in secret, plus its partner, @ZEISS_Group, showed off waveguides years ago at CES, and since that's the biggest optics company in the world, it is an easy assumption to say that Zeiss is working on the displays that Apple will use.\n\nElsewhere in the suites, @Goertek_USA was showing off a new \"heavyweight\" with 4k displays, think of an Apple Vision Pro. Except it was only about 100 grams. Reference design, so not in real products yet. \n\nBut all this points to that every year from now on we'll see a lot more displays on people's faces.\n\nAt XReal they told me their Holodeck glasses are coming later this year.",

      "content": "@UziCryptoo Yeah, I've noticed this quite a bit over the last year, and it's getting worse for certain kinds of content producers. It's like somebody at X has already decided, \"Oh, Scoble should only get seen 50,000 times today.\" If you start spreading yourself over everyone's posts—resharing and commenting a lot—it won't give you more than those 50,000 views. Instead, it splits that 50,000 up into little bites.\n\nBecause of this, there's some pressure to slow down your posting pace:\n1. Only post once, or perhaps one to three times\n2. Limit yourself to five or ten comments, rather than 200\n\nThey're trying to knock down spam, which is a good thing, but this changes the service to be much more news-focused rather than \"yakety-yak\" focused. I'm still out to lunch on whether this is a good or bad thing. There are certainly benefits; my feed has been way more interesting lately. \n\nHowever, I'm seeing a lot of complaints from people saying they can't get seen anymore. I could certainly make those complaints too; even with 500,000 followers, I am certainly not having everyone see my posts. I can tell because when people see a post, they usually like it or comment on it, but my latest post only has 35 likes after a couple of hours.",

      "content": "For some reason I see A LOT of masculinized women faces when I visit Brazil\n\nThere's something specific going on there where women are having surgery to get a masculine jawline, because most Brazilian influencer women kinda look like this and it's horrid\n\nI feel it's like they are trying to impress/attract/signal to other women instead of men, which isn't great\n\nWhy this specifically happens more in Brazil than in for US where there's also lots of plastic surgery, I wonder a lot\n\n\"The travestization of the feminine is a psyop that has been happening for more than ten years. One of its milestones was the moment when gay makeup artists began to occupy the place of aesthetic authority over what would be the “feminine beauty,” ceasing to interpret femininity to, little by little, prescribe it. \n\nThe result of this turning point was a feminine aesthetic that is increasingly artificial, hyperconstructed, and standardized, guided by exaggerated, angular, and performative traits, often dissociated from concrete female corporeality. \n\nThat’s why nowadays many surgeries and procedures no longer aim to enhance the feminine, but rather to replace it with a technical caricature, an imitation of traits that were born outside of the feminine experience itself.\n\nVery sad.\"",

The arrests are based on the so-called hate speech accusations.\n\nThe defenders of these arrests say that these comments often contain threats of violence against some groups of people, and they say that the principle is the same as if you made comments offline in a public space.\n\nThe difference is actually colossal. We have only one planet, and in the city we live, there is a limited number of public spaces one cannot avoid if they want to be able to leave home.\n\nOnline, on the other hand, there's an infinity of public places. If you think that in some places they can talk to you in a way you don't like or threaten you, just DON'T FUCKING GO to such online places.\n\nThere's no lack of online places where no one will physically be able to threaten you. There's actually an infinity of such places.\n\nBut you, for some reason, decide to go to places where they post stuff offensive to you. Are you a masochist?\n\nNo, there's no equivalence between online and offline. Anyone claiming there is, is either an illiterate retard or a left-wing manipulator (but likely both).",
