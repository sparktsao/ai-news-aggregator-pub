      "title": "In software, the code documents the app. In AI, the traces do.",
      "content": "TL;DRIn traditional software, you read the code to understand what the app does - the decision logic lives in your codebaseIn AI agents, the code is just scaffolding - the actual decision-making happens in the model at runtimeBecause of this, the source of truth for what your app does shifts from code to traces - traces document what your agent actually did and whyThis changes how we debug, test, optimize, monitor, collaborate, and understand product usageIf you&apos;re building agents without good observability, you&apos;re missing the source of truth for what your system actually doesIn traditional software, when something goes wrong, you read the code. When you want to understand how a feature works, you read the code. When you want to improve performance, you profile the code. The code is the source of truth.In AI agents, this doesn&apos;t work anymore.Why Code Doesn&apos;t Document Agent BehaviorIn traditional software, if you want to understand what happens when a user submits a form, you open handleSubmit() and read the function. The decision logic is right there: validate inputs, check authentication, call the API, handle errors. It&apos;s deterministic - same input, same code path, same output.In AI agents, code is just scaffolding.Here&apos;s a simplified version of what agent code actually looks like:agent = Agent(\n    model=&quot;gpt-4&quot;,\n    tools=[search_tool, analysis_tool, visualization_tool],\n    system_prompt=&quot;You are a helpful data analyst...&quot;\n)\nresult = agent.run(user_query)\nYou&apos;ve defined the pieces: which model, which tools, what instructions. But the decision logic isn&apos;t in your code. It just orchestrates LLM calls.The actual decisions - which tool to call when, how to reason through the problem, when to stop, what to prioritize - all of that happens in the model at runtime.&#x1f4a1;As the LLM drives more and more of your app (as happens with agents), you have less and less visibility into what the app will actually do just by looking at the code.You can still debug your orchestration code - whether tool calling works, whether parsing works. But you can&apos;t debug the intelligence. Whether the agent makes good decisions, whether it reasons effectively - that logic lives in the model, not in your codebase.Traces as the New DocumentationSo where does the actual behavior live? In the traces.A trace is the sequence of steps an agent takes. It documents the logic of your app - the reasoning at each step, which tools were called and why, the outcomes and timing.&#x1f4a1;This means that operations you would do on code in the software world, you now do on traces in the agent world. Debugging, testing, profiling, monitoring - all of these shift from operating on code to operating on traces.In traditional software, if two runs produce different outputs, you assume different inputs or different code. In AI agents, the same input with the same code can produce different outputs. Different tool calls, different reasoning chains, different outcomes.The only way to understand what happened is to look at the trace. Why did Task A succeed but Task B fail? Compare the traces. Did your prompt change improve reasoning? Compare traces before and after. Why does the agent keep making the same mistake? Look at the pattern across traces.How This Changes Building AgentsWhen the source of truth for logic moves from code to traces, everything else follows. All the operations you used to do on code - debugging, testing, optimizing, monitoring - now need to center around traces. Let&apos;s look at what this means in practice.Debugging Becomes Trace AnalysisWhen a user reports &quot;the agent failed,&quot; you don&apos;t open the code and look for a bug. You open the trace and look for where the reasoning went wrong. Did the agent misunderstand the task? Call the wrong tool? Get stuck in a loop?The &quot;bug&quot; isn&apos;t a logic error in your code. It&apos;s a reasoning error in what the agent actually did.Example: An agent keeps retrying the same failed API call five times before giving up. Your code has retry logic - that works fine. The bug is that the agent isn&apos;t learning from the error message. You only see this in the trace: same tool call, same parameters, same failure, repeated.You Can&apos;t Set a Breakpoint in ReasoningIn traditional software, when you find a bug, you set a breakpoint in the code.In AI agents, you can&apos;t set a breakpoint in reasoning. The decision happens inside the model.But you can set a breakpoint in logic using traces + playgrounds. Open a trace at a particular point in time - right before the agent made the bad decision. Load that exact state into a playground. The playground is like a debugger, but for reasoning instead of code.You can see: What context did the agent have? What was in its memory? What tools were available? What did the prompt look like? Then you iterate - adjust the prompt, change the context, try different approaches - and see if the agent makes a better decision.Testing Becomes Eval-DrivenNow that the source of truth for logic is in traces, you need to test those traces. This means two things:First: you need a pipeline to add traces to your test dataset. As your agent runs, you capture traces and add them to a dataset that you can eval against.Second: you need to eval traces in production. In traditional software, you test before deployment and ship. In AI, agents are non-deterministic, so you need to continuously eval in production to catch quality degradation and drift.Performance Optimization ChangesIn traditional software, you profile the code to find hot loops and optimize algorithms. In AI agents, you profile traces to find decision patterns - unnecessary tool calls, redundant reasoning, inefficient paths. The bottleneck is in the agent&apos;s decisions, and those only exist in traces.Monitoring Shifts from Uptime to QualityAn agent can be &quot;up&quot; with 0 errors and still be performing terribly - succeeding at the wrong task, succeeding inefficiently at 10x the cost, or giving correct but unhelpful answers.You need to monitor quality of decisions, not just system health - task success rate, reasoning quality, tool usage efficiency. You can&apos;t monitor quality without sampling and analyzing traces.Collaboration Moves to Observability PlatformsIn traditional software, collaboration happens in GitHub. You review code, leave comments on PRs, discuss implementation in issues. The code is the artifact everyone works with.In AI agents, the logic isn&apos;t in the code - it&apos;s in the traces. So collaboration has to happen where the traces are too. Sure, you still use GitHub for the orchestration code. But when you&apos;re debugging why the agent made a bad decision, you need to share a trace, add comments on specific decision points, discuss why it chose this path. Your observability platform becomes a collaboration tool, not just a monitoring tool.Product Analytics Merges with DebuggingIn traditional software, product analytics is separate from debugging. Mixpanel tells you what users clicked. Your error logs tell you what broke. They&apos;re different tools for different questions.In AI agents, these merge. You can&apos;t understand user behavior without understanding agent behavior. When you see &quot;30% of users are frustrated&quot; in your analytics, you need to open traces to see what the agent did wrong. When you see &quot;users asking for data analysis features&quot;, you need to look at traces to see which tools the agent is already choosing and what&apos;s working. The user experience is the agent&apos;s decisions, and those decisions are documented in traces - so product analytics has to be built on traces.Make the shiftIn traditional software, the code is your documentation. In AI agents, the trace is your documentation.The shift is simple: when the decision logic moves from your codebase to the model, your source of truth moves from code to traces. &#x1f4a1;Everything you used to do with code - debugging, testing, optimizing, monitoring, collaborating - you now do with traces.To make this work, you need good observability. Structured tracing that you can search, filter, and compare. The ability to see the full reasoning chain - which tools were called, how long things took, what it cost. The ability to run evals on historical data to monitor quality over time.If you&apos;re building agents and you don&apos;t have this, you&apos;re working blind. The logic that matters only exists in those traces.",

      "title": "Why Fujitsu Thinks Computing Isn\u2019t a Choice Between Quantum or AI",
      "content": "\nThe tech industry often paints the AI future as a race for dominance. One breakthrough replaces the last, with the promise of a tech revolution. But some of the biggest decisions shaping computing today are not about choosing winners; rather, it\u2019s about learning how different systems can work together.\n\n\n\nThat thinking underpins how Fujitsu is approaching its next phase of growth. Fujitsu is reshaping its presence in India, positioning the country as a core centre for research and intelligence rather than a low-cost engineering base.\n\n\n\nIn a roundtable with AIM, Ken Toyoda, MD and CEO of Fujitsu Research of India Private Limited (FRIPL); Okai Jungo, head of technology business management; and Priyanka Sharma, director of software engineering and business head of the Monaka R&amp;D Unit at FRIPL, outlined how this strategy is taking shape.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, India\u2019s association with Fujitsu had largely been limited to electronics and hardware. That perception has shifted. The company has moved key research work in high-performance computing and quantum systems to India, reflecting a broader internal transition.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree years back, our business was primarily in that sector,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cBut now, India has become our nodal centre for cutting-edge IT, which is HPC, quantum.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNot Everything Needs Quantum\n\n\n\nThe Japanese technology company views quantum computing, AI, and high-performance computing as parts of a broader system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Fujitsu has built and deployed superconducting quantum systems, it does not present quantum as a universal solution. Instead, it emphasises matching problems to the right computing architecture.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot every computation needs quantum, and not every computation needs GPUs or CPUs,\u201d Sharma remarked. The company believes sustainability in computing comes from carefully choosing systems, rather than defaulting to the most advanced option.\n\n\n\nThis approach forms the basis of Fujitsu\u2019s hybrid computing strategy. The model combines traditional processors, GPUs, and quantum computers, with a software layer that selects the most suitable resource for each task.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has to basically be able to pick the optimal computing architecture, based on the application,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nQuantum computing, in Fujitsu\u2019s view, remains best suited for specific use cases. Drug discovery is one such area where the challenge lies in running vast permutations to identify viable molecules. Classical systems struggle to scale these calculations efficiently.\n\n\n\n\u201cIdentification of a new drug molecule is a permutation problem,\u201d Sharma emphasised. \u201cThat is where quantum computing comes into play.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven then, Fujitsu sees quantum working alongside classical computing. Toyoda revealed that the company currently operates a 256-qubit quantum computer and plans to release a 1,000-qubit system next year. A 10,000-qubit machine is already in development.\n\n\n\nRobots That Feel the Room\n\n\n\nBeyond computing infrastructure, Fujitsu is investing extensively in physical AI. The focus is on ensuring that robotics can interact with people and environments, rather than just perform repetitive tasks.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s research spans robotics, AI, and material science. The executives described a future where robots respond to human emotions and collaborate with other machines in shared spaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is physical AI,\u201d Sharma said, \u201cwhere you are able to add the right emotional gesture on the face of the robot.\u201d\n\n\n\nFujitsu does not see this as a single-company effort. Its leadership argues that robotics ecosystems will involve many platforms, standards, and control systems. Without coordination, such systems risk failing in real-world settings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe future of robotics is not just one company providing all the robots,\u201d Jungo said, warning that fragmented systems could break down without shared frameworks. This belief also extends beyond robotics.\n\n\n\nMany Hats\n\n\n\nAcross AI, quantum computing, and security, Fujitsu is pushing for collaboration as a necessity rather than a choice. The company has established small research laboratories at universities in Japan and overseas, and continues to expand academic partnerships.\n\n\n\nFujitsu has also helped establish a consortium to address AI-led misinformation, bringing together dozens of companies across markets. The goal is to build shared standards rather than isolated solutions. \u201cSecurity is not just [about] one company, but we need a standard of collaboration,\u201d Jungo said.\n\n\n\nHealthcare is another area where Fujitsu has leaned into partnerships. Last year, the company announced a collaboration with IBM Japan, despite the two firms competing in other domains. Fujitsu leaders said systemic change in healthcare requires more than strong technology.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because you have good technology doesn\u2019t mean you can change the healthcare system,\u201d Jungo added. \u201cThese two companies together, we can really change it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIndia as an Intelligence Centre\n\n\n\nFujitsu\u2019s growing research footprint in India reflects a deeper shift in its view of the country. The company now employs around 400 researchers in India, many of whom hold advanced degrees in AI and computing.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, what we see in India is very different, a country that provides the intelligence,\u201d Jungo said. The company stressed that cost is not the primary driver. Instead, Fujitsu values adaptability and problem-solving ability among Indian researchers.\n\n\n\n\u201cFocus is not to develop it at a lesser cost,\u201d Toyoda added. \u201cThe focus is to capture the goodness in Indian talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nFujitsu is also looking beyond top universities and metro cities into tier-2 and tier-3 cities in the near future, while remaining selective in its hiring. The company does not recruit in bulk, preferring targeted research roles that sit at the intersection of multiple disciplines.\n\n\n\nThat approach reflects Fujitsu\u2019s long-term philosophy. The company identifies its strength not in stability, but in constant reinvention. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t change is we keep changing,\u201d Toyoda said.\nThe post Why Fujitsu Thinks Computing Isn\u2019t a Choice Between Quantum or AI appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",
