The scene should immediately convey the themes of the day's news to readers.\n\n## The Mascot (CRITICAL)\nThe attached image shows our skunk mascot. You MUST:\n- Keep the EXACT circuit board pattern on the skunk's body and tail - this is a core part of the brand identity\n- Maintain the skunk's white and black coloring with the tech circuit pattern visible\n- The skunk must be ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING related to the topics - typing on a keyboard, reading papers, adjusting equipment, pointing at a screen, holding tools, etc. NOT just standing and smiling at the camera!\n- Position the skunk in the lower-left or lower-right portion, engaged with the scene\n\n## Today's Stories\n\n**Topic 1: AI Safety & Regulatory Crisis**\nThe UK government threatened fines and a potential ban on X after Grok was used to generate non-consensual sexual images of women and children, with Elon Musk framing it as free speech suppression. Research from the AI Incidents Database forecasts 6-11x increases in AI-related incidents over five years, while an Anthropic researcher argues alignment may require 70+ years of iterative development. A critical security vulnerability (CVE-2026-0757) was also flagged in Claude Desktop MCP Manager.\n**Topic 2: AI Agent Tracing Infrastructure**\nLangChain published analysis arguing that runtime traces, not code, are now the source of truth for understanding AI agent behavior. Harrison Chase emphasized that traces are the lifeblood of agent improvement loops, while Simon Willison highlighted Sprites.dev by Fly.io as critical infrastructure for sandboxing AI coding agents. OpenAI is also pursuing agent development by asking contractors to upload real workplace documents from past jobs.\n**Topic 3: GPT-5.2 Capabilities & Explainability Gap**\nGPT-5.2 demonstrated remarkable capabilities by solving Erd\u0151s problem #729 with a formal Lean proof, marking the second Erd\u0151s problem solved by an LLM without prior human solution. However, Ethan Mollick noted a significant explainability gap where GPT-5.2 Pro produces impressive results but thinking traces are often unrelated to actual output. Greg Brockman endorsed GPT-5.2 specifically for agentic tasks.\n**Topic 4: xAI Industry Controversy**\nAnthropic reportedly cut off xAI's access to Claude models for coding purposes, sparking heated debate about AI lab competition and data usage ethics across Reddit communities. This compounds ongoing controversy around Grok's content moderation failures, with WIRED documenting systematic abuse targeting women in religious clothing including hijabs and saris.\n**Topic 5: AI Reasoning & Architecture Debate**\nA substantive technical argument on LessWrong against continuous chain-of-thought (neuralese) challenges OpenAI's research direction, claiming discrete tokens are architecturally necessary. Geoffrey Hinton's claim that LLMs now reason through contradiction sparked discussion about unbounded self-improvement, while rigorous testing debunked popular prompting myths showing threats and rewards don't meaningfully affect model performance.\n**Topic 6: AI Coding Tools Evolution**\nThe AI coding ecosystem saw significant activity with tips from Anthropic's bcherny on using Claude Code with large codebases gaining 751 likes and 141K views. The vibe coding discourse on r/ClaudeAI generated 306 comments revealing sharp divides between traditional developers and AI-assisted programmers, while Harrison Chase asked what Claude Code for non-developers would look like.\n\n## Visual Direction\nCreate a scene that represents these stories. You must include Topic 1 (the top story), then pick 2-3 others that would make the best scene together. Consider:\n- What visual metaphors could represent these themes?\n- How can the skunk mascot interact with or observe these elements?\n- Suggested scene elements: shield icons, protective barriers, guardrails, server racks, cooling systems, blue LED glow, data center, thought bubbles, chain of logic, decision trees\n\n## Style Requirements\n- Playful cartoon illustration, tech editorial art style\n- Vibrant colors with Trend Red (#E63946) accents\n- Energetic, forward-looking, tech-optimistic mood\n- No Trend Micro logos or watermarks - but other company logos (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) are encouraged when relevant to the stories",

          "content": "TL;DRIn traditional software, you read the code to understand what the app does - the decision logic lives in your codebaseIn AI agents, the code is just scaffolding - the actual decision-making happens in the model at runtimeBecause of this, the source of truth for what your app does shifts from code to traces - traces document what your agent actually did and whyThis changes how we debug, test, optimize, monitor, collaborate, and understand product usageIf you&apos;re building agents without good observability, you&apos;re missing the source of truth for what your system actually doesIn traditional software, when something goes wrong, you read the code. When you want to understand how a feature works, you read the code. When you want to improve performance, you profile the code. The code is the source of truth.In AI agents, this doesn&apos;t work anymore.Why Code Doesn&apos;t Document Agent BehaviorIn traditional software, if you want to understand what happens when a user submits a form, you open handleSubmit() and read the function. The decision logic is right there: validate inputs, check authentication, call the API, handle errors. It&apos;s deterministic - same input, same code path, same output.In AI agents, code is just scaffolding.Here&apos;s a simplified version of what agent code actually looks like:agent = Agent(\n    model=&quot;gpt-4&quot;,\n    tools=[search_tool, analysis_tool, visualization_tool],\n    system_prompt=&quot;You are a helpful data analyst...&quot;\n)\nresult = agent.run(user_query)\nYou&apos;ve defined the pieces: which model, which tools, what instructions. But the decision logic isn&apos;t in your code. It just orchestrates LLM calls.The actual decisions - which tool to call when, how to reason through the problem, when to stop, what to prioritize - all of that happens in the model at runtime.&#x1f4a1;As the LLM drives more and more of your app (as happens with agents), you have less and less visibility into what the app will actually do just by looking at the code.You can still debug your orchestration code - whether tool calling works, whether parsing works. But you can&apos;t debug the intelligence. Whether the agent makes good decisions, whether it reasons effectively - that logic lives in the model, not in your codebase.Traces as the New DocumentationSo where does the actual behavior live? In the traces.A trace is the sequence of steps an agent takes. It documents the logic of your app - the reasoning at each step, which tools were called and why, the outcomes and timing.&#x1f4a1;This means that operations you would do on code in the software world, you now do on traces in the agent world. Debugging, testing, profiling, monitoring - all of these shift from operating on code to operating on traces.In traditional software, if two runs produce different outputs, you assume different inputs or different code. In AI agents, the same input with the same code can produce different outputs. Different tool calls, different reasoning chains, different outcomes.The only way to understand what happened is to look at the trace. Why did Task A succeed but Task B fail? Compare the traces. Did your prompt change improve reasoning? Compare traces before and after. Why does the agent keep making the same mistake? Look at the pattern across traces.How This Changes Building AgentsWhen the source of truth for logic moves from code to traces, everything else follows. All the operations you used to do on code - debugging, testing, optimizing, monitoring - now need to center around traces. Let&apos;s look at what this means in practice.Debugging Becomes Trace AnalysisWhen a user reports &quot;the agent failed,&quot; you don&apos;t open the code and look for a bug. You open the trace and look for where the reasoning went wrong. Did the agent misunderstand the task? Call the wrong tool? Get stuck in a loop?The &quot;bug&quot; isn&apos;t a logic error in your code. It&apos;s a reasoning error in what the agent actually did.Example: An agent keeps retrying the same failed API call five times before giving up. Your code has retry logic - that works fine. The bug is that the agent isn&apos;t learning from the error message. You only see this in the trace: same tool call, same parameters, same failure, repeated.You Can&apos;t Set a Breakpoint in ReasoningIn traditional software, when you find a bug, you set a breakpoint in the code.In AI agents, you can&apos;t set a breakpoint in reasoning. The decision happens inside the model.But you can set a breakpoint in logic using traces + playgrounds. Open a trace at a particular point in time - right before the agent made the bad decision. Load that exact state into a playground. The playground is like a debugger, but for reasoning instead of code.You can see: What context did the agent have? What was in its memory? What tools were available? What did the prompt look like? Then you iterate - adjust the prompt, change the context, try different approaches - and see if the agent makes a better decision.Testing Becomes Eval-DrivenNow that the source of truth for logic is in traces, you need to test those traces. This means two things:First: you need a pipeline to add traces to your test dataset. As your agent runs, you capture traces and add them to a dataset that you can eval against.Second: you need to eval traces in production. In traditional software, you test before deployment and ship. In AI, agents are non-deterministic, so you need to continuously eval in production to catch quality degradation and drift.Performance Optimization ChangesIn traditional software, you profile the code to find hot loops and optimize algorithms. In AI agents, you profile traces to find decision patterns - unnecessary tool calls, redundant reasoning, inefficient paths. The bottleneck is in the agent&apos;s decisions, and those only exist in traces.Monitoring Shifts from Uptime to QualityAn agent can be &quot;up&quot; with 0 errors and still be performing terribly - succeeding at the wrong task, succeeding inefficiently at 10x the cost, or giving correct but unhelpful answers.You need to monitor quality of decisions, not just system health - task success rate, reasoning quality, tool usage efficiency. You can&apos;t monitor quality without sampling and analyzing traces.Collaboration Moves to Observability PlatformsIn traditional software, collaboration happens in GitHub. You review code, leave comments on PRs, discuss implementation in issues. The code is the artifact everyone works with.In AI agents, the logic isn&apos;t in the code - it&apos;s in the traces. So collaboration has to happen where the traces are too. Sure, you still use GitHub for the orchestration code. But when you&apos;re debugging why the agent made a bad decision, you need to share a trace, add comments on specific decision points, discuss why it chose this path. Your observability platform becomes a collaboration tool, not just a monitoring tool.Product Analytics Merges with DebuggingIn traditional software, product analytics is separate from debugging. Mixpanel tells you what users clicked. Your error logs tell you what broke. They&apos;re different tools for different questions.In AI agents, these merge. You can&apos;t understand user behavior without understanding agent behavior. When you see &quot;30% of users are frustrated&quot; in your analytics, you need to open traces to see what the agent did wrong. When you see &quot;users asking for data analysis features&quot;, you need to look at traces to see which tools the agent is already choosing and what&apos;s working. The user experience is the agent&apos;s decisions, and those decisions are documented in traces - so product analytics has to be built on traces.Make the shiftIn traditional software, the code is your documentation. In AI agents, the trace is your documentation.The shift is simple: when the decision logic moves from your codebase to the model, your source of truth moves from code to traces. &#x1f4a1;Everything you used to do with code - debugging, testing, optimizing, monitoring, collaborating - you now do with traces.To make this work, you need good observability. Structured tracing that you can search, filter, and compare. The ability to see the full reasoning chain - which tools were called, how long things took, what it cost. The ability to run evals on historical data to monitor quality over time.If you&apos;re building agents and you don&apos;t have this, you&apos;re working blind. The logic that matters only exists in those traces.",

          "title": "Why Fujitsu Thinks Computing Isn\u2019t a Choice Between Quantum or AI",
          "content": "\nThe tech industry often paints the AI future as a race for dominance. One breakthrough replaces the last, with the promise of a tech revolution. But some of the biggest decisions shaping computing today are not about choosing winners; rather, it\u2019s about learning how different systems can work together.\n\n\n\nThat thinking underpins how Fujitsu is approaching its next phase of growth. Fujitsu is reshaping its presence in India, positioning the country as a core centre for research and intelligence rather than a low-cost engineering base.\n\n\n\nIn a roundtable with AIM, Ken Toyoda, MD and CEO of Fujitsu Research of India Private Limited (FRIPL); Okai Jungo, head of technology business management; and Priyanka Sharma, director of software engineering and business head of the Monaka R&amp;D Unit at FRIPL, outlined how this strategy is taking shape.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, India\u2019s association with Fujitsu had largely been limited to electronics and hardware. That perception has shifted. The company has moved key research work in high-performance computing and quantum systems to India, reflecting a broader internal transition.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree years back, our business was primarily in that sector,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cBut now, India has become our nodal centre for cutting-edge IT, which is HPC, quantum.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNot Everything Needs Quantum\n\n\n\nThe Japanese technology company views quantum computing, AI, and high-performance computing as parts of a broader system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Fujitsu has built and deployed superconducting quantum systems, it does not present quantum as a universal solution. Instead, it emphasises matching problems to the right computing architecture.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot every computation needs quantum, and not every computation needs GPUs or CPUs,\u201d Sharma remarked. The company believes sustainability in computing comes from carefully choosing systems, rather than defaulting to the most advanced option.\n\n\n\nThis approach forms the basis of Fujitsu\u2019s hybrid computing strategy. The model combines traditional processors, GPUs, and quantum computers, with a software layer that selects the most suitable resource for each task.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has to basically be able to pick the optimal computing architecture, based on the application,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nQuantum computing, in Fujitsu\u2019s view, remains best suited for specific use cases. Drug discovery is one such area where the challenge lies in running vast permutations to identify viable molecules. Classical systems struggle to scale these calculations efficiently.\n\n\n\n\u201cIdentification of a new drug molecule is a permutation problem,\u201d Sharma emphasised. \u201cThat is where quantum computing comes into play.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven then, Fujitsu sees quantum working alongside classical computing. Toyoda revealed that the company currently operates a 256-qubit quantum computer and plans to release a 1,000-qubit system next year. A 10,000-qubit machine is already in development.\n\n\n\nRobots That Feel the Room\n\n\n\nBeyond computing infrastructure, Fujitsu is investing extensively in physical AI. The focus is on ensuring that robotics can interact with people and environments, rather than just perform repetitive tasks.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s research spans robotics, AI, and material science. The executives described a future where robots respond to human emotions and collaborate with other machines in shared spaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is physical AI,\u201d Sharma said, \u201cwhere you are able to add the right emotional gesture on the face of the robot.\u201d\n\n\n\nFujitsu does not see this as a single-company effort. Its leadership argues that robotics ecosystems will involve many platforms, standards, and control systems. Without coordination, such systems risk failing in real-world settings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe future of robotics is not just one company providing all the robots,\u201d Jungo said, warning that fragmented systems could break down without shared frameworks. This belief also extends beyond robotics.\n\n\n\nMany Hats\n\n\n\nAcross AI, quantum computing, and security, Fujitsu is pushing for collaboration as a necessity rather than a choice. The company has established small research laboratories at universities in Japan and overseas, and continues to expand academic partnerships.\n\n\n\nFujitsu has also helped establish a consortium to address AI-led misinformation, bringing together dozens of companies across markets. The goal is to build shared standards rather than isolated solutions. \u201cSecurity is not just [about] one company, but we need a standard of collaboration,\u201d Jungo said.\n\n\n\nHealthcare is another area where Fujitsu has leaned into partnerships. Last year, the company announced a collaboration with IBM Japan, despite the two firms competing in other domains. Fujitsu leaders said systemic change in healthcare requires more than strong technology.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because you have good technology doesn\u2019t mean you can change the healthcare system,\u201d Jungo added. \u201cThese two companies together, we can really change it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIndia as an Intelligence Centre\n\n\n\nFujitsu\u2019s growing research footprint in India reflects a deeper shift in its view of the country. The company now employs around 400 researchers in India, many of whom hold advanced degrees in AI and computing.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, what we see in India is very different, a country that provides the intelligence,\u201d Jungo said. The company stressed that cost is not the primary driver. Instead, Fujitsu values adaptability and problem-solving ability among Indian researchers.\n\n\n\n\u201cFocus is not to develop it at a lesser cost,\u201d Toyoda added. \u201cThe focus is to capture the goodness in Indian talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nFujitsu is also looking beyond top universities and metro cities into tier-2 and tier-3 cities in the near future, while remaining selective in its hiring.

          "content": "Main thesis: Discrete token vocabularies don't lose information so much as they allow information to be retained in the first place. By removing minor noise and singling out major noise, errors become identifiable and therefore correctable, which continuous latent representations fundamentally cannot offer.The Bandwidth Intuition (And Why It's Incomplete)One of the most elementary ideas connected to neuralese is increasing bandwidth. After the tireless mountains of computation called a forward pass, we condense everything down to ~17 bits (the log\u2082 of our vocabulary size).This seems insane. Imagine pitching a neural network architecture where layers 5, 10, 15, and 20 have hidden dimension 20, while normal layers use 512. You'd be laughed out of the room. And that's not even accounting for discreteness.So why do I think this apparent insanity is not just tolerable but necessary for LLMs?The Noise Accumulation ProblemLet's imagine LLMs passed vast latent messages instead of tokens - say, the final hidden state or something a few matrix multiplications away from it. No bandwidth concerns. Pure continuous reasoning.This message won't be perfect. The forward pass involves finite compute, imperfect optimization, distributional shift as we move off the training manifold, etc.. Call this aggregate imperfection \"noise\" or \"error\".Here's the problem: noise in continuous space has no natural factorization.When a 4096-dimensional vector is slightly \"off,\" which components are errors and which are intentional signal? The representations weren't designed with error boundaries. The noise is semantically entangled with the message. There's no way to look at the latent state and say \"that part is the mistake.\"This noise might occasionally get recognized and corrected, but this shouldn't be expected. There are too many values the noise can manifest in, too many ways it can blend with legitimate concepts, not easily distinguishable for the next forward pass to catch.So the noise accum...",

In the regime where the AI has to do many of these bad actions in order to cause an unacceptable outcome, we have some hope of identifying examples of the AI doing the bad action (or at least having some signal at distinguishing bad actions from good ones). Given such a signal we could: Directly train the policy to not perform bad actions. Train activation monitors to detect bad actions. These monitors could be used in a variety of ways such as: Rejecting actions flagged as bad. Either resample a response from the same policy, or using some different process. Look into bad actions further, to try to incriminate the AI. Incrimination based strategies are out of scope for this post: I'll be solely interested in the question of: What should we expect the sample efficiency of training policies and monitors to be at removing bad behavior?

You may have seen this graph from Chris Olah illustrating a range of views on the difficulty of aligning superintelligent AI: Evan Hubinger, an alignment team lead at Anthropic, says: If the only thing that we have to do to solve alignment is train away easily detectable behavioral issues...then we are very much in the trivial/steam engine world. We could still fail, even in that world\u2014and it\u2019d be particularly embarrassing to fail that way; we should definitely make sure we don\u2019t\u2014but I think we\u2019re very much up to that challenge and I don\u2019t expect us to fail there. I disagree; if governments and AI developers don't start taking extinction risk more seriously, then we are not up to the challenge. Thomas Savery patented the first commercial steam pump in 1698. [1] The device used fire to heat up a boiler full of steam, which would then be cooled to create a partial vacuum and draw water out of a well. Savery's pump had various problems, and eventually Savery gave up on trying to improve it. Future inventors improved upon the design to make it practical. It was not until 1769 that Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot developed the first steam-powered vehicle, something that we would recognize as a steam engine in the modern sense. [2] The engine took Cugnot four years to develop. Unfortunately, Cugnot neglected to include brakes\u2014a problem that had not arisen in any previous steam-powered devices\u2014and at one point he allegedly crashed his vehicle into a wall. [3] Imagine it's 1765, and you're tasked with building a steam-powered vehicle. You can build off the work of your predecessors who built steam-powered water pumps and other simpler contraptions; but if you build your engine incorrectly, you die. (Why do you die? I don't know, but for the sake of the analogy let's just say that you do.) You've never heard of brakes or steering or anything else that automotives come with nowadays.

I later returned to it, and the second time around, with a little more experience (and finding a more useful exposition), its importance was much easier to grasp. I now believe that this result is incredibly central to the use of Bayesian reasoning in a wide range of practical contexts, and yet seems to not be very well known (I was not able to find any mention of it on LessWrong). I think it is at the heart of some common confusions, where seemingly strong Bayesian arguments feel intuitively wrong, but for reasons that are difficult to articulate well. For example, I think it is possibly&nbsp;the central error that Rootclaim made in their lab-leak argument, and although the judges were able to come to the correct conclusion, the fact that seemingly no one was able to specifically nail down this issue has left the surrounding discussion muddled in uncertainty. I hope to help resolve both this and other confusions.&nbsp;Satellite conjunction&nbsp;The best exposition of the FCT that I have found&nbsp; is \u201cSatellite conjunction analysis and the false confidence theorem.\" The motivating example here is the problem of predicting when satellites are likely to collide with each other, necessitating avoidance maneuvers. The paper starts by walking through a seemingly straightforward application of Bayesian statistics to compute an epistemic probability that 2 satellites will collide, given data (including uncertainty) about their current position and motion. At the end, we notice that very large uncertainties in the trajectories correspond to a very&nbsp;low epistemic belief of collision. Not&nbsp;uncertainty, but rather&nbsp;high confidence of safety.

A superagent may be constructed from a well-scaffolded cluster of artificial intelligences, but in the near-term it\u2019s far more likely that superagents will consist of one or more humans, aided by well-scaffolded AIs, since humans still have a few properties vital to agency that AIs haven\u2019t fully acquired (yet).&nbsp;As with \u2018superintelligence\u2019, there\u2019s no canonical demarcation between superagentic actors and non-superagentic actors; there are only so many different properties which are likely to end up being strongly correlated at large scale, but which may end up uncoupled in particular cases (especially transitional ones), producing a jagged frontier of agency.Here\u2019s a list of possible properties by virtue of which an actor may achieve superagency.Principle 1 (Directedness)A superagent may have vastly improved self-monitoring, introspection, and control.In most intellectual tasks, humans spend the overwhelming majority of their time in predictably unproductive patterns: they are caught up in minutiae, overpolishing what ought to be discarded, failing to filter distractors.

The approach is very similar to the existing LessWrong work analyzing AI discourse on Twitter/Bluesky, but instead of categorizing p(doom) discourse, we want to find \"important\" and \u201cunderrated\u201d people.Approach:Find important people in the AI Twitter sphere via PageRankFind the \u201cunderrated\u201d people with low follow count from step 1.Find consistently \u201chigh signal\u201d people from step 1 via an LLM.Six 'famous' users were used to bootstrap PageRank, chosen for high quality public contributions. After a round of convergence, the top ranked handle is added (removing organizations), repeating until we have ~200 \"core\" handles. Finally, we cut the list down to top 749 and rerun one last time.

The primary reasons are:The bottleneck for creating good AI safety researchers isn't the kind of knowledge contained in the ARENA notebooks, but the hands-on research engineering and research skills involved in day-to-day research.I think the current version of ARENA primarily functions as a signaling mechanism in the current state of the AI safety ecosystem.Context and disclaimersThis post was written using Superwhisper and then asking Gemini to transcribe into a blog post format. I have done some light editing. Some of this might look like AI slop. I apologize, but I think the value of this post is pretty good as is, and it is not a good use of my time to refine it further.&nbsp;I am not saying that Arena is not valuable. Arena is obviously valuable, and deserves the high reputation it has in the AI safety ecosystem.&nbsp;Why am I well positioned to think about this? In the past year and a half, I have participated in a large slew of AI safety schemes, both as a participant and as a teacher or lead. This includes ML4Good, both as a participant and as TA, SPAR as a participant, AI Safety Camp as a project lead, ARENA as a participant and as a TA, Algoverse both as a mentor and as a participant, &nbsp;BlueDot both as a participant and a facilitator. &nbsp;Furthermore, I am currently a research manager at MATS so I'm getting a close-up view of what skills are required to do high-quality AI safety research.The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of MATS.The Core Problem with the Current ARENAMy primary concern is that the skills learned in the current ARENA program are not the bottleneck for the AI Safety ecosystem.Skills Mismatch: AI safety resea...",

          "content": "(I'm reposting this here from an old Dreamwidth post of mine, since I've seen people reference it occasionally and figure it would be easier to find here.) So people throw around the word \"impossible\" a lot, but oftentimes they actually mean different things by it. (I'm assuming here we're talking about real-world discussions rather than mathematical discussions, where things are clearer.) I thought I'd create a list of different things that people mean by \"impossible\", in the hopes that it might clarify things. Note -- because we're talking about real-world things, time is going to play a role. (Yes, there's not really any universal clock. Whatever.) I'm listing these as \"levels of impossibility\", going roughly from \"most impossible\" to \"least impossible\", even though they're not necessarily actually linearly ordered. Also, some of the distinctions between some of these may be fuzzy at times. Level 0. Instantaneously inconsistent. The given description contains or logically implies a contradiction. It rules out all possible states at some point in time, in any universe. People often claim this one when they really mean level 2 or level 3. Level 1. Instantaneously impossible (contingently). In the actual universe we live in, the given description is instantaneously impossible; it rules out all possible states at some point in time. I think in most discussion that isn't about physics this isn't actually strongly distinguished from level 0. Level 2. Non-equilibrium. The described system fails to propagate itself forward in time; or, if a system extended in time is described, it contains an inconsistency. This is one that people often actually mean when they say something is \"impossible\". Level 3. Unstable equilibrium or possible non-equilibrium. The described system is not resilient to noise; it will not propagate itself forward in time unless exceptional conditions hold continually. This is another one that people often really mean when they say something is \"impossi...",

Each framework seems to offer its own version: think rigorously enough, examine yourself honestly enough, surrender deeply enough, and (here my anxiousness steps in, with its own interpretations) you\u2019ll finally achieve certainty. You won\u2019t ask yourself whether you\u2019ve got it all wrong anymore. You\u2019ll know that you\u2019re doing it right, taking the right path, being the right sort of person.&nbsp;This isn\u2019t what I believed consciously. I would, confidently, say that certainty is unattainable, and that it's better to keep one\u2019s mind agile and open to new evidence. This seemed like the only respectable position to me. My behaviour, however, has suggested a less relaxed attitude: relentless rumination, nose-length scrutiny of my motives, endless reassurance-seeking through rumination and feedback, and an inability to fully commit to, but also fully leave behind, any framework I\u2019ve encountered.This has come with some heavy costs.&nbsp;The price of over-indexing on epistemic rigourOscillating between frameworksThe primary consequence: a sort of analytical paralysis in my spiritual commitments. For a long time I saw this as avoiding premature foreclosure, but now I suspect that it actually comes from needing certainty before acting: needing to be as sure as possible that this is the right path, the right community, the right teacher, befo...",

It's free to use. You can use any model, free or paid. There's no pressure to keep a specific format or obligation to follow any rules.\n\nGive it a try.",

For some reason Aristotle was struggling with formalising, taking multiple days over many attempts to fully complete.\n\nNote - literature review is still ongoing so I will update if any previous solution is found.\n\nlink to image, Terence Tao's list of AI's contributions to Erdos Problems - https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems",

          "content": "[https://files.catbox.moe/pvlbzs.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/pvlbzs.mp4)\n\nHey Reddit,\n\nI have been experimenting a bit with LTX-2's I2V, and like many others was struggling to get good results (still frame videos, bad quality videos, melting etc.). Scowering through different comment sections and trying different things, I have compiled of list of things that (seem to) help improve quality.\n\n1. Always generate videos in landscape mode (Width &gt; Height)\n2. Change default fps from 24 to 48, this seems to help motions look more realistic.\n3. Use LTX-2 I2V 3 stage workflow with the Clownshark Res\\_2s sampler.\n4. Crank up the resolution (VRAM heavy), the video in this post was generated at 2MP (1728x1152). I am aware the workflows the LTX-2 team provides generates the base video at half res.\n5. Use the LTX-2 detailer LoRA on stage 1.\n6. Follow LTX-2 prompting guidelines closely. Avoid having too much stuff happening at once, also someone mentioned always starting prompt with \"A cinematic scene of \" to help avoid still frame videos (lol?).\n\nArtifacting/ghosting/smearing on anything moving still seems to be an issue (for now).\n\nPotential things that might help further:\n\n1. Feeding a short Wan2.2 animated video as the reference images.\n2. Adjusting further the 2stage workflow provided by the LTX-2 team (Sigmas, samplers,  remove distill on stage 2, increase steps etc)\n3. Trying to generate the base video latents at even higher res.\n4. Post processing workflows/using other tools to \"mask\" some of these issues.\n\nI do hope that these I2V issues are only temporary and truly do get resolved by the next update. As of right now, it seems to get the most out of this model requires some serious computing power. For T2V however, LTX-2 does seem to produce some shockingly good videos even at the lower resolutions (720p), like [this one](https://files.catbox.moe/rjy5il.mp4) I saw posted on a comment section on huggingface.\n\nThe video I posted is \\~11sec and took me about 15min to make using the fp16 model.

          "content": "BEFORE MAKING THIS THREAD, I was Googling around to see if anyone else had found this out. I thought for sure someone had stumbled on this. And they probably have. I probably just didn't see it or whatever, but I DID do my due diligence and search before making this thread.\n\nAt any rate, yesterday, while doing an ITV generation in LTX-2, I meant to copy/paste an image from a folder but accidentally copy/pasted a GIF I'd generated with WAN 2.2. To my surprise, despite GIF files being hidden when you click to load via the file browser, you can just straight-up copy and paste the GIF you made into the LTX-2 template workflow and use that as the ITV input, and it will actually go frame by frame and add sound to the GIF.\n\n**But THAT is not the reason this is useful by itself.** Because if you do that, it won't change the actual video. It'll **just add sound.**\n\nHowever, let's say you use a 2 or 3-second GIF. Something just to establish a basic motion. Let's say a certain \"position\" that the model doesn't understand. It can add time to that following along with what came before.\n\nThus, a 2-second clip of a 1girl moving up and down (I'll be vague about why) can easily become a 10-second with dialogue and the correct motion because it has the first two seconds or less (or more) as reference.\n\nIdeally, the shorter the GIF (33 frames works well) the better. The least amount you need to have the motion and details you want captured. Then of course there is some luck, but I have consistently gotten decent results in the 1 hour I've played around with this. But I have NOT put effort into making the video quality itself better. That I would imagine can be easily done via the ways people usually do it. I threw this example together to prove it CAN work.\n\nThe video output likely suffers from poor quality only because I am using much lower res than recommended.\n\n***Exact steps I used:***\n\nWan 2.2 with a LORA for ... something that rhymes with \"cowbirl monisiton\"\n\nI created a gif using 33 frames, 16fps.\n\nCopy/pasted GIF using control C and control V into the LTX-2 ITV workflow. Enter prompt, generate.\n\nUsed the following prompt: A woman is moving and bouncing up very fast while moaning and expressing great pleasure. She continues to make the same motion over and over before speaking. The woman screams, \"\\[WORDS THAT I CANNOT SAY ON THIS SUB MOST LIKELY. BUT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT IN THE COMMENTS\\]\"\n\nI have an example I'll link in the comments on Streamable. Mods, if this is unacceptable, please feel free to delete, and I will not take it personally.\n\n*Current Goal:* Figuring out how to make a workflow that will generate a 2-second GIF and feed it automatically into the image input in LTX-2 video.\n\n***EDIT:*** if nothing else, this method also appears to **guarantee** non-static outputs. I don't believe it is capable of doing the \"static\" non-moving image thing when using this method, as it has motion to begin with and therefore cannot switch to static.\n\n***EDIT2:*** It turns out it doesn't need to be a GIF. There's a node in comfy that has an output of \"image\" type instead of video. Since MP4s are higher quality, you can save the video as a 1-2 second MP4 and then convert it that way. The node is from **VIDEO HELPER SUITE** and looks like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7bt3j4hugjcg1.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74aa0585c18609c9ed41f5dae9f413b5acabb740\n\n",

          "content": "EDIT: Ok. People call me weird. People call me a Microsoft robot. I have the entire chat history with Claude that led to this article. It's long. It's chaotic. It's 3 AM energy. But if you want to confirm I'm real and see what human + AI collaboration actually looks like \u2014 let me know right here. And I'll post it. Unedited.\n\n\n# Stop Calling It \"Vibe Coding\" Like It's an Insult\n\n**The gatekeeping has to stop.**\n\n---\n\nI've been in this industry for 38 years. Started on a Commodore 64 at age 6, in Denmark, before I could speak English. I've worked every layer of the stack \u2014 hardware, telecom, infrastructure, security, development. I've done it the hard way, by choice, for decades.\n\nI'm not here to list credentials. I'm here to say this:\n\n**The anti-AI gatekeeping in programming is embarrassing. It needs to stop.**\n\n---\n\n## \"Vibe Coding\" Is Just the Latest Insult\n\nEvery generation of developers finds a way to gatekeep the next.\n\n- \"You use an IDE? Real programmers use vim.\"\n- \"You use a framework? Real programmers write everything from scratch.\"\n- \"You use Stack Overflow? Real programmers read documentation.\"\n- \"You use AI? That's just *vibe coding*.\"\n\nIt's the same garbage recycled. Different decade, same insecurity.\n\n\"Vibe coding\" is just the newest term designed to make people feel bad for using tools that make them more productive. It's not a critique. It's a put-down dressed up as standards.\n\n---\n\n## The Hypocrisy Is Unreal\n\nWhen I was starting out, I built things that already existed \u2014 libraries, tools, systems that had perfectly good implementations. When I asked questions in forums, the response was always:\n\n**\"Don't reinvent the wheel.\"**\n\nMy answer: *If I don't at least try, how do I truly understand how it works?*\n\nSo I reinvented wheels. That's how I learned.\n\nAnd now? The same crowd that told us to stop reinventing wheels is furious that AI helps people avoid reinventing wheels.\n\nYou can't win:\n- Build it yourself \u2192 \"Stop reinventing the wheel!\"\n- Use existing libraries \u2192 \"You don't really understand it!\"\n- Use AI assistance \u2192 \"That's not REAL programming!\"\n\nPick a lane.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Talk About What You Actually Do\n\nBe honest. Every day you:\n\n- Copy from Stack Overflow without reading the full thread\n- `npm install` packages with thousands of lines you'll never audit\n- Use frameworks that abstract away everything\n- Google error messages and paste the first solution\n- Let your IDE auto-complete half your code\n\nBut someone uses AI to generate a function and edits it to fit their needs?\n\n**FRAUD. NOT A REAL DEVELOPER.**\n\nThe double standard is absurd.\n\n---\n\n## \"BuT tHeY dOn'T uNdErStAnD tHe CoDe\"\n\nNeither do you.\n\nYou don't understand the V8 engine's internals. You don't understand how your framework actually works under the hood. You don't understand the cryptography in your dependencies. You don't understand the OS scheduler running your code.\n\nYou understand *enough*. You trust the layers beneath you and build on top.\n\nThat's called **abstraction**. It's the entire history of computing.\n\nAI is just the next layer. The question was never whether you understand every line. The question is whether you understand enough to architect, debug, and ship.\n\n---\n\n## A Quick Story\n\nI love mechanical keyboards. Old IBM Model Ms. But they were ugly \u2014 that yellowed plastic. So I spray-painted mine completely black. Every key. No letters. No symbols. Nothing.\n\nEvery time a coworker said \"let me show you something,\" they'd sit down, look at the keyboard, and freeze.\n\n\"Oh... fuck. I forgot. Never mind. You do it.\"\n\nEvery. Single. Time.\n\nThe point? I wasn't trying to prove anything. I just liked how it looked. But somehow, not having letters on my keyboard was fine. Using AI to help write code? UNACCEPTABLE. FRAUD.\n\nThe gatekeeping was always arbitrary. It was always about ego. It was never about standards.\n\n---\n\n## \"Are You Using ChatGPT?\"\n\nThis one's my favorite.\n\nFirst \u2014 ChatGPT? What year is it?\n\nSecond \u2014 yes, people use AI tools. They also use spell check. They use grammar tools. They use autocomplete. They use linters and formatters and a hundred other things that assist their work.\n\nDo you interrogate writers for using spell check? \"Can't you spell?\"\n\nThe AI accusation is just the new way of saying \"you're not legitimate.\" It's not about quality. It's about gatekeeping.\n\n---\n\n## What This Is Really About\n\n**Pride.** Developers wrap their identity in \"I solve hard problems.\" When AI does in seconds what took years to learn, it stings. But your value was never in syntax memorization \u2014 it was in knowing *what* to build and *why*.\n\n**Fear.** If anyone can output code quickly, what happens to the hierarchy? It's a real concern. But the answer isn't to shame people \u2014 it's to adapt.\n\n**Sunk cost.** \"I suffered to learn this, so you should too.\" That's hazing, not standards.\n\n---\n\n## The Tools Won\n\nEvery generation fights the next tool. Every generation loses.\n\n- Nobody writes assembly by hand anymore\n- Nobody hand-codes everything a framework provides\n- Nobody manually formats code when linters exist\n- Nobody refuses autocomplete to prove they're \"real\"\n\nAI assistance is next. The developers who embrace it will build faster and aim higher. The ones who refuse will spend their time on Reddit explaining why everyone else is wrong.\n\n---\n\n**Stop calling it \"vibe coding\" like it's an insult.**\n\n**Stop interrogating people about whether they used AI.**\n\n**Stop pretending your resistance is about quality when it's about ego.**\n\n**Use the tools. Build things. Ship.**\n\n---\n\n*Yes, I used AI to help write this. I also edited every word. Just like I do with every tool I've ever used.*\n\n*That's not a confession. That's just how work gets done now.*\n\n### Cry about it",
