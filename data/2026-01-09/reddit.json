      "content": "Hey everyone,\n​I’ve been reading the text of the \"NO FAKES Act\" currently in Congress, and it’s worse than I thought.\n​The Tldr: It creates a \"digital replica right\" for voices/likenesses. That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who \"makes available\" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.  \n​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).\n​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.\n\nWhat I did:\nI contacted my reps email to flag this as an \"innovation killer.\" If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a \"Safe Harbor\" for tool devs.\n\nS.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc\n\nUPDATE: ACTION ITEMS (How to actually stop this)\n​If you don't want to go to jail for hosting a repo, you need to make noise now.\n​1. The \"Lazy\" Email (Takes 30 seconds):\nGo to Democracy.io or your Senator’s contact page.\n​Subject: Opposition to NO FAKES Act (H.R. 2794 / S. 1367) - Open Source Liability\n​Message: \"I am a constituent and software engineer. I oppose the NO FAKES Act unless it includes a specific Safe Harbor for Open Source Code Repositories. The current 'Digital Fingerprinting' requirement (Section 3) is technically impossible for raw model weights to comply with. This bill effectively bans open-source AI hosting in the US and hands a monopoly to Big Tech. Please amend it to protect tool developers.\"\n​2. The \"Nuclear\" Option (Call them):\n​Call the Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224-3121\n​Ask for Senators Wyden (D) or Massie (R) if you want to thank them for being tech-literate, or call your own Senator to complain.\n​Script: \"The NO FAKES Act kills open-source innovation.

      "content": "I know everyone’s been posting about Opus 4.5 lately but I had to share this because it still doesn’t feel real.\nI’m not an iOS developer but a product manager. Never written Swift in my life. Had this idea for a simple routine timer app sitting in my notes for months. Figured I’d finally try building it with Claude Code.\n\nThree weeks later I have a fully functional app on my phone.\n\nIt’s called FlowRoutine - basically a calm timer that shows you what’s NOW and what’s NEXT in your routine. No complicated task management, just follow the flow. Lock Screen widgets, Dynamic Island, the whole thing.\n\nWhat got me about Opus 4.5:\nIt stopped asking me to clarify everything. Previous versions would ask 10 questions before doing anything. Opus 4.5 just… understood what I meant and made reasonable decisions. When I said “make it feel calm and minimal” it actually did that instead of asking me to define “calm.”\n\nIt caught my bad ideas before I implemented them. Multiple times it was like “I can do this but here’s why that might cause issues later” and suggested better approaches. Felt like working with a senior dev, not a code generator.\n\nThe debugging was different. When something broke, it actually reasoned through the problem instead of just throwing solutions at the wall.\n\nNot saying it’s perfect - had a few moments where it got overconfident and changed things I didn’t ask for. But overall? This thing is wild.\nAnyone else shipping stuff they never thought they could build?",

This is still a relatively underexplored concept however the recent surge of research suggests why it is gaining traction.\n\nFor example, Marble demonstrates how multimodal models that encode a *sense of the world* can achieve far greater efficiency and reasoning capability than LLMs, which are inherently limited to predicting the next token. Genie illustrates how 3D interactive environments can be learned and simulated to support agent planning and reasoning. Other recent work includes SCOPE, which leverages world modelling to match frontier LLM performance (GPT-4-level) with far smaller models (millions versus trillions of parameters), and HunyuanWorld, which scored \\~77 on the WorldScore benchmark. There are also new models being developed that push the boundaries of world modelling further.\n\nIt seems the AI research community is beginning to recognize the practical and theoretical advantages of world models for reasoning, planning, and multimodal understanding.\n\nCurious, who else has explored this domain recently? Are there emerging techniques or results in world modelling that you find particularly compelling? Let us discuss.\n\nps: See the comments for references to all the models mentioned above.",

      "content": "Check the link for the full new skill file which you can use in your workflow!\n\nBeen poking around Anthropic's open-source Skills repo (the system prompts that give Claude specialized capabilities). The frontend-design skill caught my eye since I do a lot of UI work.\n\nReading through it, I noticed something odd: the skill tells Claude to \"never converge on common choices across generations\" and that \"no design should be the same.\" The intent makes sense, they want Claude to avoid repetitive patterns. But Claude can't see its other conversations. Every chat is isolated. It's like telling someone not to repeat what they said in their sleep.\n\nThis got me down a rabbit hole of rewriting the whole thing. Clearer instructions, fixed contradictions, expanded the guidance on typography/color/spatial composition. The kind of stuff that sounds good to us as humansbut doesn't actually tell the model what to do.\n\nTo make sure I wasn't just making it worse, I built a little auto eval system: 50 design prompts, run both versions, and have Opus 4.5 judge them not knowing which is which.. Ran it across Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The revised skill won 75% of head-to-head comparisons.\n\nInteresting side finding: the improvements helped smaller models more than Opus. My guess is Opus can compensate for ambiguous instructions, while Haiku needs the explicit guidance.\n\nSubmitted a PR to Anthropic. Wrote up the whole process if anyone's curious (check the Link URL, you can also see the PR on the skills repo which shows the whole diff between the two)\n\nCurious if others have dug into the Skills repo or have thoughts on prompt clarity for this kind of thing. :-)",

      "content": "I manage a rental property remotely. Today my brain kind of broke.\n\nI asked Claude to help with some tenant emails. But instead of just drafting a response, it went full autonomous:\n\n1. Searched my inbox for the tenant's emails\n2. Read the full thread to get context\n3. Opened the rental contract (I keep it as Markdown)\n4. Modified the 2 clauses my tenant was asking about\n5. Converted it to PDF with Pandoc\n6. Sent the updated contract back as an attachment\n\nI was just... watching. No prompting each step. It figured out what needed to happen and did it.\n\n# How I set this up\n\n**The Gmail part:**\n\nI built a simple Python CLI wrapper around Gmail API yesterday. Nothing fancy - just OAuth2 auth and basic operations exposed as commands:\n\n    gm search \"from:john\"           # search emails\n    gm thread &lt;id&gt;                  # read full conversation\n    gm send \"to\" \"subj\" \"body\" -a file.pdf   # send with attachment\n    gm reply &lt;id&gt; \"message\"         # reply to a thread\n    \n\nIt's maybe 200 lines of Python. The magic is that Claude Code can just call these from bash like any other tool.\n\n**The rest:**\n\n* Claude Code CLI (Opus 4.5) on WSL2\n* Contracts in Markdown with some LaTeX for signatures\n* Pandoc for the PDF conversion\n\n# What Claude actually ran\n\n    gm search \"from:tenant\"     → found the emails\n    gm thread &lt;id&gt;              → read the conversation  \n    cat contract.md             → checked the current contract\n    vim contract.md             → edited 2 lines\n    pandoc → contract.pdf       → generated the PDF\n    gm send -a contract.pdf     → sent it back\n    \n\nThe whole thing took maybe 2 minutes.\n\n[claude code terminal doing all the job](https://preview.redd.it/kmdiaa7md5cg1.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbe3b042e12363e1bea4ff9ce5c6cabbb17ef054)\n\n[gmail web](https://preview.redd.it/qt5h71pmd5cg1.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63738070b38c5f0bc6d48f7ad94b614dae2256cd)\n\n# Takeaway\n\nYou don't need complex integrations. Just give Claude Code some CLI tools and it chains them together on its own. I'm probably going to build more of these - calendar, bank statements, who knows.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar?",

It also fails at complex motion. When I tested multi-character motion, it generated a still frame with audio only, no movement. Texture preservation is decent, but sometimes results come out blurry or oversaturated. Upscaling and audio are excellent, and the model is fast, but it needs a memory-cache clear after almost every run. It also occasionally refuses to run for no clear reason, then works on the next attempt without changing anything.\n\nRight now, I don’t see it becoming my main model, maybe after community optimizations. It’s fun for goofy or simple generations, but not for actual work.\n\nAs for WAN, it’s been out long enough that the community already knows its strengths and limitations, so I won’t go into detail.\n\n\n\nLTXV2: [https://files.catbox.moe/81f1yu.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/81f1yu.mp4)\n\nWAN2.2: [https://files.catbox.moe/va0wq3.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/va0wq3.mp4)\n\n",

Below that, it gets painful.\n* **Quality isn’t amazing yet**, especially compared to commercial tools.\n* Audio is decent, better than early Kling/Sora/Veo prototypes.\n* Camera-control LoRAs exist and work, but the process is still clunky.\n\nThat said, the *open-source factor* matters.  \nLike Wan 2.2 before it, LTX2 feels more like a **lab** than a product. You don’t just generate, you actually see how video generation works under the hood.\n\nFor anyone interested, I’m releasing **multiple ComfyUI workflows** soon:\n\n* image → video with LTX2\n* 3×3 image → video (QwenVL)\n* 3×3 image → video (Gemini)\n* vertical grids (2×5, 9:16)\n\nNot claiming this is the future.  \nBut it’s clearly pointing somewhere interesting.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper if anyone’s curious.",

If you're using the workflow templates that come with ComfyUI-LTXVideo to do your renders, the problem may not be with the model itself.\n\nGo to the \"Steps 3 - Inputs\" group node. Then look at the \"Enhancer\" group-within-a-group, and expand the first node.\n\nSurprise, you've got a helper: https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/9f32382e0823.png\n\nYour workflow is leveraging Gemma3 with a system prompt to enhance whatever your positive prompt is. And since it's Gemma3, if your prompt goes against Gemma3's delicate moral sensibilities, this is what your \"prompt\" ends up being enhanced to: https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/df1f5eecf61a.png\n\nSo that ends up getting passed to the sampler in lieu of your prompt.\n\nSolution? Just bypass the node if you plan on doing anything that may upset Gemma3, which is pretty easy to do. If you really want prompt enhancement _and_ to prompt anything risky, integrate your favorite local LLM and reroute through there instead.\n\nThis is a major culprit for failures. I have at times seem the model choke a bit if the prompt had more dialog than could reasonably be fit into the allotted render time, but still, I suspect this one is tripping people up.",

      "content": "I’m a 19-year-old software engineering student from the Netherlands. I’ve been working on a custom experimental architecture that fuses the most efficient post-Transformer ideas into a single system.\n\nI call it **Hyper-Mnemosyne**.\n\nI have written the code, fixed the gradients (thanks to a brutal audit here), and successfully trained a **150M parameter prototype** on my local RTX 3090. It converges (Loss 11.5 → 5.89) and learns grammar, but I lack the compute resources to do a full-scale run to prove it can learn complex semantics.\n\n# The Architecture:\n\n* **Backbone:** **Mamba-2 (SSM)** for linear scaling (no quadratic attention bottleneck).\n* **Memory:** Implemented a **Titans-Inspired Gated Residual Memory**. This is a simplified adaptation of the Neural Memory module that inserts a gated memory buffer into the residual stream.\n* **Objective:** Added a **JEPA-Inspired Auxiliary Loss** (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture). The model is trained to predict the *latent representation* of the next text span, enforcing semantic density beyond simple token prediction.\n* **Optimization:** I implemented the **Muon optimizer** (Newton-Schulz iterations) to orthogonalize updates for 2D internal parameters, while strictly keeping embeddings/heads on AdamW for stability.\n* **Kernels:** I wrote custom **Fused Triton Kernels** for the Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC). The Sinkhorn-Knopp mixing iterations are fused directly on the GPU to prevent the multi-branch overhead from killing training speed.\n\n# Why I’m posting this:\n\nI have pushed the limits of what I can do on my single gaming GPU. The architecture **works**—the inference code generates coherent English syntax after just 1,000 steps of training.\n\nI am looking for someone with spare compute (H100/A100 cluster or a serious multi-GPU rig) who wants to collaborate on a real training run.\n\nIf you have the hardware and are bored of just fine-tuning Llama 3, I’d love to see what this architecture can actually do when scaled up and fed 1T+ tokens.\n\n# Code &amp; Blueprint:\n\nThe repo includes the full source, the Triton kernels, and a [Blueprint.md](http://Blueprint.md) explaining the theory.[https://github.com/Svel26/Hyper-Mnemosyne.git](https://github.com/Svel26/Hyper-Mnemosyne.git)\n\nLet me know what you think of the implementation.  \n\n\n**Update on the Hyper-Mnemosyne saga.**\n\nAfter the community audit (and a massive refactor), I successfully trained the 150M prototype for 1,000 steps on FineWeb-Edu.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n* **Loss:** 11.5 → 5.89 (Learned Syntax/Grammar).\n* **JEPA Loss:** 0.15 (Latent prediction is converging without collapse).\n* **Inference:** It has moved from looping \"The State\" to generating grammatical (if slightly hallucinatory) text: *\"The future of AI is the first place about the name of the previous...\"*\n\n**The Lesson:** You guys were right. The initial code was slop. The breakdown of the symmetry collapse and the optimizer split was the wake-up call I needed.\n\nThe architecture (Mamba-2 + mHC + JEPA) should now be technically sound. It just needs scale (billions of tokens, not thousands) to learn actual semantics. I’m cleaning up the repo and leaving it up as a template for anyone who wants to experiment with hybrid architectures correctly.\n\nThanks for the tough love. Code is pushed. ✌️",

We needed access to raw token probabilities to measure perplexity (the model's \"surprise\"), so open weights were mandatory.\n\nThe pipeline was pretty simple. We got recordings of people talking about their expected future self, used Claude Sonnet to generate two \"future narratives\" for each person (one where they have a crisis, one where they don't). Then we fed those into Llama-3.1-8B to score which narrative was more linguistically plausible based on the patient's interview transcript.\n\nThe results were that if the suicidal narrative was more probable (lower perplexity), that person was significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation 18 months later. It actually caught 75% of the high-risk people that standard suicide medical questionnaires missed.\n\nPaper and Code: [https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fhzum\\_v1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Fpreprints%2Fpsyarxiv%2Ffhzum_v1)\n\nI'm planning on exploring other models (larger, newer, thinking models, etc).

      "content": "Anthropic's most recent [engineering blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents), makes it clear you need long-term memory, but how should you achieve this? I'm new to Claude Code, but here are some examples I've found during my research:\n\n1. [`spec-kit`](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) \\- For defining what you want to develop upfront and using it as a scaffold for an agent. Video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eR1xsfvHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eR1xsfvHg)\n2. [`beads`](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) \\- For storing memory as you go (I think, the repo isn't overly clear, and I stumbled across it on Reddit). Tutorial video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWBVMEHPgQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWBVMEHPgQU)\n3. [`claude-mem`](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) \\- Provides an SQLite and Vector database via an MCP server for storing memory and maintaining project context. Docs: [https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/getting-started](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/getting-started)\n4. [`claude-task-master`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) \\- For setting up and managing tasks, again via an MCP server, it seems. It looks as though this can be used in Cursor as well. They have a website: [https://www.task-master.dev/](https://www.task-master.dev/)\n\nThese are just the examples I've found reading Reddit asking questions, and doing some research with AI. From what I can see, it seems the following is important:\n\n* Always start with a well-defined plan. I've seen a lot of talk about Project Requirement Documents (PRDs) for this. Personally, my team works in Feature -&gt; Epic -&gt; Task, I don't know how PRDs fit this structure, but something along these lines I guess.\n* Provide a software architecture up front, potentially composed of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).\n* Keep track of new architecture level decisions in ADRs.\n* Keep track of useful reflections on working in the repo in some memory format (beads, markdown, etc.)\n* Keep track of tool calls and outputs for cost-free semantic search.\n* Track your feature list and incrementally move through your software plan.\n* Potentially allow your AI to update the software plan on the fly.\n\nI would be interested to know from people on this forum:\n\nA) Are the tools I've found good tools?  \nB) Are there any must-have tools I've missed?  \nC) Do you agree with my list of important concerns for long-running memory?",

      "content": "I've been building something unusual with Claude Code and wanted to share it.\n\nThe short version: I use Claude Code to run a [website ](https://rangeroftherealms.com)and YouTube channel about Tolkien lore. \n\nWhat feels different is I don't think about \"I built a thing with Claude Code\" - I did but... - I think about how I use Claude Code itself as the continuous interface for managing everything. It's my command center. \n\nType /today and get a summary along with my production schedule and todos.  Type /create-lore-episode and 90 minutes later there's a finished video ready for review. Type /weekly-analysis and I get a synthesis of YouTube performance, X trends, and competitive gaps.\n\nBut the interesting part isn't the automation. It's how the system feels to use.\n\n**A bit of the backstory to start...**\n\nI'm a casual Tolkien fan (loved lord of the rings series) and while watching Rings of Power I found myself constantly pausing to look up explainer videos about the lore. Who was Celebrimbor? What happened to the Two Trees? The universe Tolkien created was wild to me. On a train ride home one night I figured I'd try to build something that makes the kind of Tolkien explainer content I'd been consuming - but on any topic I wanted.  This felt like a logical and interesting extension of some of the experiments I had run at [dreambytes.ai](http://dreambytes.ai)\n\nTwo hours of working with Claude Code later, I had episode one. And...it wasn't slop. I actually liked it. Not in a sense of 'I'm so proud I made this' - but it was content I actually liked consuming.\n\nThat was early November. Now after a couple months of iterating - I have \\~40+ episodes, a schedule that auto-maintains itself, and a system that reflects on its own output and updates its own instructions when it finds bad patterns. \n\n**A brain that rewires itself and...learns**\n\nWhat surprised me is how the system grows. I keep adding capabilities: a new agent for shorts, a playlist manager, a trends analyzer. It's like teaching a brain. The project structure IS the brain. [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) , the agents, the slash commands are all the working memory. When I add a new skill, Claude Code just... knows it's there. It can explore its own architecture and figure out how things work.\n\nChatting with a friend about it I called it \"non-deterministic robustness\".  What I meant was...I can say \"the thumbnails we generated are boring - make 3 different options.\" There's no \"retry thumbnail\" function. A year ago you'd need to build that explicitly. But the system just understands...\"ok, I'll go generate thumbnails the way I did during production, but try different styles.\"\n\nNothing breaks. To me, this genuinely feels like working with another person (a pretty smart and tenacious one).\n\n**This feels different**\n\nMost Claude Code experiences are about building discrete things. Here I'm sort of using Claude Code as persistent infrastructure:\n\n* It has state. Schedule, backlog, learnings—all stored as JSON the system reads and updates.\n* It improves itself. Monthly reflection analyzes all scripts for patterns (\"100% use the same opening\" → updates its own agent instructions).\n* I stay in the loop. Approval gate before anything publishes. AI proposes, human decides.\n\nThe meta-insight for me is that Claude Code isn't just a coding assistant. It can be a natural interface for managing anything with workflows and state. The conversation IS the control panel.\n\n**Tons of fun...**\n\nI didn't set out to build a \"content system.\" I wanted to explore Tolkien in a medium I actually enjoy. The system emerged from iterating on that simple goal. And I've learned more about Tolkien's universe than I ever expected...which was the whole point.\n\nIt's been a genuinely fun project. \n\nIf you're curious about the architecture or the philosophy behind it, I wrote more at \n\n[https://rangeroftherealms.com/system](https://rangeroftherealms.com/system)\n\n[https://rangeroftherealms.com/about](https://rangeroftherealms.com/about)\n\nOpen to questions or feedback. \n\nAnyone else using Claude Code as an ongoing operational layer rather than just a build tool?\n\n",

      "title": "Nvidia Research Presents TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression | \"Closing the Generative Quality Gap between Diffusion and Autoregressive Models\"",
      "content": "####Abstract:\n\n&gt;Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. \n&gt;\n&gt;**We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks.** This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second. \n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\nImagine you have a massive, heavy dictionary that you must open to find the perfect next word for a story. Right now, standard AI models work by heaving this heavy book onto the table, finding just one single word, and then putting the book away. To write a sentence, they have to lift and open this heavy book over and over again for every individual word. The process is slow not because reading the word is hard, but because moving the heavy book takes so much time.\nTiDAR changes this by making better use of that heavy lifting. Now, when the AI heaves the book onto the table to find one word, it uses that same moment to quickly guess the next several words all at once. Since the book is already open and the AI is very fast at thinking, guessing these extra words essentially happens for free during the time the book is just sitting there.\nOnce the AI has its main word and its list of guesses, it quickly checks to see if the guesses make sense. Because the guesses are usually good, the AI ends up writing four or five words in a single \"trip\" instead of just one. This means the story gets written nearly five times faster without the AI having to work any harder or lift the heavy book any more often.\n\n---\n\n#####Link to the Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08923",

      "content": "**TL;DR:** where does the line sit between vibe-coded slop and an implementation that deserves respect? If we consider the same tools to be used what actually flips the switch on public opinion?\n\nNobody likes AI slop, whether it's infographics with gibberish words, or code that \"works\" but is a matryoshka doll of nested functions, side effects, silent failures, and architectural design that requires the entire codebase to be refactored just to add a new button.\n\nWith the rapid improvements and adoption of tools like Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, we are seeing the entry cost to coding reduce. More people can ship and so more people *will* ship. Velocity goes up, friction goes down, and output will inevitably explode and I'm sure many people are already seeing this. \n\nSo regarding this new wave of apps and code inbound, we find ourselves asking a different question to that of other AI spaces. It is no longer \"was this AI-generated?\", but \"does this deserve to exist?\"\n\nAnd that fundamentally begs the question: **At what point does something stop being vibe-coded slop and become a praiseworthy implementation, even if the author leaned heavily on AI the whole way through?** Or do people thing these two things are fundamentally incompatible? \n\nIs this about how much oversight a person has on the output, and if so, are we requiring developers to sit and assess code, or more confident that workflows like BMAD are able to handle this, but the person slapping \"make app X that does Y, hurr hurr machine goes burr\" where minimal intent or judgement is applied, and everything ends up looking and feeling the same, with code that’s about as flexible as an icicle\n\nGenuinely curious where people land on this. What’s your personal \"not AI-slop\" success criteria? Is there any emerging consensus, or is this still very much an open question?",

Simulating these adversarial dynamics offers a glimpse into the future, where deployed LLMs might compete against one another for computational or physical resources in the real world.",
      "content": "####Abstract:\n\n&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. \n&gt;\n&gt;Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. \n&gt;\n&gt;Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation: \n\nResearchers created a digital deathmatch called Core War where AI-written programs, dubbed \"warriors,\" compete to crash one another's software in a shared virtual memory space. They utilized a system named Digital Red Queen (DRQ), where a Large Language Model continuously evolves new code specifically designed to kill the previous generation of winners. This setup creates a perpetual arms race; because the \"enemy\" is constantly improving, the AI cannot rely on a single static trick and must relentlessly adapt and upgrade its strategies just to survive, mirroring the \"Red Queen\" effect in biology where organisms must constantly evolve to avoid extinction.\n\nThe experiment produced AI agents that became increasingly \"generalist,\" meaning they stopped being good at just killing one specific rival and became robust enough to destroy a wide range of human-designed programs they had never encountered before. Even more striking was that independent experiments starting with different code consistently converged on the same winning behaviors. While the actual lines of code (genotype) remained different, the effective strategies (phenotype) became nearly identical, proving that there are universal, optimal ways to dominate in this digital environment that the AI will inevitably discover on its own. \n\n**This demonstrates that relatively simple self-play loops can autonomously drive the evolution of highly effective, dangerous, and robust software capabilities without human guidance.**\n\n\n---\n\n#####Link to the Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335\n\n----\n\n\n#####Link to the GitHub with minimalistic implementation of DRQ to get you started ASAP: https://github.com/SakanaAI/drq\n",

      "content": "**TL;DR:** Claude Code 2.1.0 support adds hot-reload (no more restarts!), context forking (parallel work!), lifecycle hooks (proper automation!), and cleaner configs.\n\nIt's been a weird week with Claude. The [2.1.0](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#210) support had some kinks that needed to be smoothed out, but once I was able to play around with the features with the 2.1.1 release, I'm thoroughly impressed.\n\nI added v2.1.0 support within [claude-night-market](https://github.com/athola/claude-night-market), my open-source plugin marketplace for Claude Code. This update introduces major workflow-changing features, which directly address pain points I've been hitting in daily dev work.\n\n\n## Important Updates\n\n\n### Skill Hot-Reload\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one to experience the tedious cycle of \"edit skill -&gt; restart Claude -&gt; test -&gt; repeat\". With the new update you can now modify skills and see changes immediately without killing your session. This capability has cut my skill development time from \\~2 minutes per tweak to \\~5 seconds. I no longer have to use [a shell script to reinstall my plugins](https://github.com/athola/claude-night-market/blob/master/scripts/reinstall-all-plugins.sh). When you're dialing in a debugging workflow or fine-tuning a code review skill, this makes a huge difference.\n\nWhen I was tuning the `abstract:skill-auditor` to check for trigger phrases, I went from \"restart-wait-test\" (2+ minutes per iteration) to \"edit-save-test\" (5 seconds). This is a 24x improvement for my skill development.\n\n```bash\n\n# Edit skill\n\nvim plugins/abstract/skills/skill-auditor/SKILL.md\n\n# Test immediately (no restart needed!)\n\nSkill(abstract:skill-auditor)\n\n```\n\n\n### Context Forking\n\nIsolated sub-agents can now be spawned (forked), which won't pollute your main conversation context:\n\nExecute multiple code reviews, parallel research tasks, or any process where you need clean separation from other subagent tasks. Think of it like opening a new notepad tab vs. cluttering your current one.\n\n```yaml\n\n# abstract:skill-improver - runs in isolation\n\ncontext: fork  # Fresh context, won't pollute main session\n\ndescription: Implements skill improvements based on observability data\n\n# abstract:skill-evaluator - isolated testing\n\ncontext: fork\n\ndescription: Validates skills without affecting main conversation\n\n```\n\nThis enables me to run  `pensive:code-reviewer` and `parseltongue:python-tester` in parallel. With forking, each gets a clean context instead of sharing token budget and conversation history.\n\n\n### Frontmatter Lifecycle Hooks\n\nWant audit logging that runs exactly once? Validation gates before tool execution? Cleanup after operations? Now it's built into skills, commands, and subagents.\n\n**Three hook types:**\n\n- `PreToolUse` - Before tool execution (validation, logging)\n\n- `PostToolUse` - After tool execution (cleanup, metrics)\n\n- `Stop` - When agent/skill completes (summaries)\n\n```yaml\nhooks:\n  PreToolUse:\n    - matcher: \"Bash\"\n      command: |\n        # Validate git commands before execution\n        if echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -qE \"git (status|diff|log)\"; then\n          echo \"[commit-agent] Git query at $(date)\" &gt;&gt; $TMP/commit-audit.log\n        fi\n      once: false  # Run every time\n    - matcher: \"Read\"\n      command: |\n        # Track file reads for commit context\n        if echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -qE \"(diff|patch|staged)\"; then\n          echo \"[commit-agent] Reading staged changes: $(date)\" &gt;&gt; $TMP/commit-audit.log\n        fi\n      once: true   # Run only once per session\n  PostToolUse:\n    - matcher: \"Bash\"\n      command: |\n        # Track commit creation\n        if echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -q \"git commit\"; then\n          echo \"[commit-agent] ✓ Commit created at $(date)\" &gt;&gt; $TMP/commit-audit.log\n        fi\n  Stop:\n    - command: |\n        echo \"[commit-agent] === Session completed at $(date) ===\" &gt;&gt; $TMP/commit-audit.log\n```\n\nYou can implement proper governance for team workflows without a bunch of cluttered, complex boilerplate.\n\n\n### Wildcard Tool Permissions\n\nAnnoyed by having to specify permissions as follows?\n\n```yaml\nallowed-tools: \"Bash(npm install), Bash(npm test), Bash(npm run build), Bash(npm run lint), Bash(npm run dev)...\"\n```\n\nNow you can do this:\n\n```yaml\nallowed-tools:\n  - Bash(npm *)       # All npm commands\n  - Bash(* install)   # Any install command\n  - Bash(git * main)  # Git commands with main branch\n```\n\nMuch easier to create cleaner configs with less repetition and more flexibility.\n\n**Patterns validated by within my marketplace:**\n\n- `Bash(npm *)` - All npm commands\n\n- `Bash(* install)` - Any install command\n\n- `Bash(git * main)` - Git with main branch\n\n- `Bash(python:*)` - Python with any argument\n\nThe `sanctum:pr-review` skill was reduced from 15 explicit tool permissions to 4 wildcard patterns.\n\n\n## Why Should I Care?\n\nClaude Code's plugin system is still young, but I'm seeing a lot of cross-collaboration in the community. I want to contribute what has worked for me, especially with these new 2.1.X updates, to those who have helped me along the way.\n\n**The hot-reload alone is worth the upgrade** if you're building skills or customizing workflows. 24x faster iteration for me has been massive for productivity.\n\n**Context forking is especially important** if you're doing parallel work or running multiple sub-agents. Clean contexts mean no more \"conversation pollution\" between specialized tasks.\n\n**Lifecycle hooks unlock proper automation**, allowing for audit trails, validation gates, and cleanup without boilerplate.",

The \"System tools\" at 14.8k - is this the JSON schema definitions for all built-in tools (Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, etc.)? Is there any way to disable tools I rarely use?\n\n  3. The autocompact buffer (45k) - I understand this is reserved headroom for responses, but is this configurable? Seems quite large.\n\n  4. For those using Claude Code daily - do you find the \\~100-120k effective working space sufficient, or do you hit context limits frequently?\n\n\n\n  What I've Already Tried:\n\n  \\- Trimmed [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) to essentials (\\~680 tokens)\n\n  \\- Removed any unused custom agents\n\n  \\- Using /clear between unrelated tasks\n\n  \\- No MCP servers configured\n\n\n\n  I'm not complaining - just trying to understand the architecture better. I know all AI coding assistants have some overhead for system prompts and tool definitions. Curious how this compares to others' experiences and if there are optimizations I'm overlooking.\n\n\n\n  Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just finished a cover-to-cover grind of Chip Huyen’s *AI Engineering* (the new O'Reilly release). Honestly? The book is a masterclass. I actually understand \"AI-as-a-judge,\" RAG evaluation bottlenecks, and the trade-offs of fine-tuning vs. prompt strategy now.\n\n**The Problem:** I am currently the definition of \"book smart.\" I haven't actually built a single repo yet. If a hiring manager asked me to spin up a production-ready LangGraph agent or debug a vector DB latency issue right now, I’d probably just stare at them and recite the preface.\n\nI want to spend the next 2-3 months getting \"Job-Ready\" for a US-based AI Engineer role. I have full access to O'Reilly (courses, labs, sandbox) and a decent budget for API credits.\n\n**If you were hiring an AI Engineer today, what is the FIRST \"hands-on\" move you'd make to stop being a theorist and start being a candidate?**\n\nI'm currently looking at these three paths on O'Reilly/GitHub:\n\n1. **The \"Agentic\" Route:** Skip the basic \"PDF Chatbot\" (which feels like a 2024 project) and build a Multi-Agent Researcher using **LangGraph** or **CrewAI**.\n2. **The \"Ops/Eval\" Route:** Focus on the \"boring\" stuff Chip talks about—building an automated **Evaluation Pipeline** for an existing model to prove I can measure accuracy/latency properly.\n3. **The \"Deployment\" Route:** Focus on serving models via **FastAPI** and **Docker** on a cloud service, showing I can handle the \"Engineering\" part of AI Engineering.\n\nI’m basically looking for the shortest path from \"I read the book\" to \"I have a GitHub that doesn't look like a collection of tutorial forks.\" Are certifications like **Microsoft AI-102** or **Databricks** worth the time, or should I just ship a complex system?\n\n**TL;DR:** I know the theory thanks to Chip Huyen, but I’m a total fraud when it comes to implementation. How do I fix this before the 2026 hiring cycle passes me by?",

      "content": "####Transcript: \n\nI wish you could feel what I'm feeling through the screen right now. This is one of the coolest pieces of tech I've seen at CES so far. This is called Haply. It's a fully 3D mouse that crucially gives 3D feedback. So you see I'm controlling this sphere on the screen right now. I control it in any axis, you can see it spinning there as I spin the pen and move it around. That's cool enough as it is. But what's even cooler is you can feel the surfaces you're interacting with.\n\nSo when I'm pushing down here, the mouse is pushing back. Like I cannot push through this surface. I feel the tension on the mouse until it breaks through. And I could like feel the texture of the surface, I could go underneath it, I can go over top of it. The fact that you feel like you're interacting with a physical object is truly insane. I hope it's coming through in the camera how crazy this is, but I could feel this in real space. And there's so many applications for this. This is just a demo. Let me show you one way they use this for like 3D design or even controlling robots.\n\nHere's an example of it hooked up to a literal robot arm. Check this out. I can move it around in space and the arm is responding in the exact way I do. What's truly insane about this, this is the first time I've touched this thing, it is so... in the same way as the other one, is just like ridiculously intuitive. Like it feels like I'm connected to this robot, which I feel like to otherwise control I'd need to be able to write like the most insane code, and yet I could just pilot this thing in real space. This is like... again you could use this for 3D modeling, crazy things like robots or just like building in your Minecraft world. This type of tech is so cool and the fact that it's consumer available is crazy. The company is called Haply, even though I don't have a robot arm to control, at least not yet, I might have to pick one of these up for my office to check out.\n\nOkay I'm cutting back in here cause they just showed me something absolutely insane. So, not only can I move the arm in space, but just like the other demo, it can sense where the physical spaces are. So I feel that surface that the robot arm is pushing on right now, but it's not driving that head into the book. There's a sensor that's only letting it barely touch, but I feel in real space that that thing is there and I cannot push through. I go over to a higher surface here, on this block, I could push all my might into it and I still can't push through it. And it's... [video cuts off] \n",

      "title": "Neural Networks Solve a Fifty Year Old Problem in Economics",
      "content": "####Explanation: \n\nEconomists have long struggled with the computational difficulty of predicting discrete choices—simple \"yes or no\" decisions like whether a person buys a house or enters the labor force. Since the 1970s, the \"maximum score estimator\" has been the standard tool for analyzing these choices when the data is messy or the underlying probability distributions are unknown. However, this method relies on \"indicator functions\"—mathematical switches that snap from zero to one. These rigid switches make the math \"nonsmooth,\" meaning standard computer algorithms struggle to find the best solutions, often requiring fragile and slow search methods.\n\nResearch by Xiaohong Chen, Wayne Yuan Gao, and Likang Wen proposes a solution derived from the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. They replace the rigid indicator function with the \"Rectified Linear Unit\" (ReLU)—the fundamental mathematical building block of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Unlike the old method, the ReLU function is continuous and possesses a specific type of smoothness that allows computers to use gradient-based optimization.\n\nThis shift offers two major advantages. First, it drastically improves statistical performance. The researchers demonstrate that this new \"ReLU-based Maximum Score\" (RMS) estimator converges on the correct answer faster than the traditional method. Second, and perhaps more importantly for practitioners, it bridges the gap between econometrics and machine learning. \n\nBecause the RMS estimator functions like a layer in a neural network, economists can now estimate complex structural parameters using powerful, off-the-shelf AI software like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\nThe implications extend beyond simple binary choices. The authors show that this method can handle \"multi-index\" problems—complex scenarios where outcomes are determined by multiple interacting factors, such as consumers choosing between products based on both utility and awareness. By integrating these economic structures into neural networks, the research offers a way to utilize the flexibility of AI while retaining the interpretability of economic theory.\n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\nFor decades, economists have used a tool called the \"maximum score estimator\" to analyze how people make discrete choices, like voting or buying a car. The problem is that this old tool relies on jagged \"step\" functions—mathematical cliffs that make it impossible to use standard, fast optimization methods like gradient descent because you cannot calculate the slope of a vertical drop. This forces researchers to use slow, brute-force search methods that require massive amounts of data to get accurate results. It is computationally inefficient and mathematically rigid, acting like a bottleneck on how fast we can model complex human behavior.\n\nThis paper introduces a \"ReLU-based\" upgrade that essentially replaces those jagged steps with smooth ramps. By using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)—the same mathematical \"neuron\" that powers most modern deep learning—the authors have created a version of the estimator that is smooth enough to be optimized instantly using standard AI hardware and software. It retains the sharp decision-making logic of the old method but allows the math to \"slide\" quickly to the correct answer rather than getting stuck on the steps. This change accelerates the convergence rate, meaning the model learns the truth significantly faster and with less data than the old approach.\n\nThe implication for acceleration is that structural economic parameters can now be embedded directly into massive deep neural networks. We no longer have to choose between the interpretability of economics and the raw power of AI; this method allows us to have both. It treats economic rules as just another layer in a deep learning stack, enabling the use of state-of-the-art tools like PyTorch to solve fundamental social science problems with unprecedented speed and scale. This is a direct compatibility patch between classical decision theory and the modern AI stack, removing a legacy constraint on computational social science.\n\n\n\n---  \n#####Link to the Explanation: https://cowles.yale.edu/news/251211/neural-networks-solve-fifty-year-old-problem-economics\n\n---\n####Link to the Paper: https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-12/d2476.pdf\n",

When Claude tries to write to a file for the first time in a session, the hook searches a local Knowledge Base. The Hook DENIES the first attempt, with the past code examples injected into the context as examples. Claude does actually see the deny reasons. THEN it allows the retry.\n\n  \nEverything runs locally with PostgreSQL support, graceful fallback to SQLite Everything runs locally. Local DB. Local Embeddings.

Basically vague prompts lead to drift or rework.\n\nI built a companion plugin today: Lisa (Ralph's big sister). Lisa is an interactive spec interviewer that generates full feature docs, then hands off to Ralph for execution. (Thanks to Thariq for ideas on how to do interview and Matt Pocock on the best practice of creating a good spec for Ralph)\n\nThe duo works really well. Basically, it's \"Lisa plans. Ralph does.\"\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Run /lisa:plan \"feature name\" (e.g., user auth flow).\n2. Lisa loops AskUserQuestion to interview you – covers UX, edge cases, trade-offs, technical details. (Inspired by Thariq's spec techniques)\n3. Stop hook keeps going until you say \"done\".\n\nOutputs comprehensive spec (with acceptance criteria) in docs/specs/.\n\nFor me:\n\n* Forces tight thinking upfront – no more \"prompt and pray\".\n* Specs are detailed enough for direct Ralph handoff (new session on the spec file).\n* Faster overall shipping.\n\nOptions like --context path or --max-questions N.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/blencorp/lisa](https://github.com/blencorp/lisa?referrer=grok.com) (PRs/feedback welcome)\n\nIf there anyone from the r/Anthropic team, I would l be happy to PR into official `ralph-loop` (maybe as /ralph-loops:lisa-plans?).

Here are the test results using the same seed; I hope it’s not too late to share.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbkms23xl3cg1.png?width=1288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75f7e09e438e88873b3a45958dc4b31889c9a0a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7ctuymbm3cg1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ff9caad0ed9ba54be15063557a92a49a40bb6c\n\nIt can even achieve better results when generating something from nothing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qreeul77o3cg1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94ec3be2eb48c9a6912de67c1c80bf6d8b45df0d\n\nI’d be happy to share this node.

      "content": "Just recently two different models were released, both designed in a way to cut a good portion of community and create artificial barriers against using those models. In both cases, the problem is the same: an unnecessary large LLM used instead of a text encoder.\n\nEven putting aside the question of using an LLM for that, the chosen sizes are deliberately inflated. For context, even an 8B LLM model is a useful tool on its own, it can be helpful in working with large texts, prototyping, simple coding and other text-focused tasks. At larger sizes, LLM can have nuanced knowledge and be stable workhorses in production.\n\nUsing a 12B LLM model as a text encoder for image or video generation is a **waste of memory** (let alone a 24B Mistral that FLUX.2 uses - it's a very good LLM on it's own). There's absolutely no way it is necessary or gives any significant benefit for composition or prompt adherence (T5 is proven to be good at that). Moreover, even if using an LLM for such task is preferred, both models have smaller versions: Gemma 3 has a 4b version, and Mistral has 8b and 12b versions (with multilanguage capabilities, like 24b has).\n\nIn both cases of LTX-2 and FLUX.2 the choice of LLMs looks deliberate. GGUF support is not a standard for now, so at the beginning we will stuck with running LLMs raw, without memory constrains-focused optimizations that llama.cpp does. This will prevent a lot of users from running the models, and both companies have incentive to force their cloud services.\n\nCompare this to Z-Image and Wan, and you will see a much more user-friendly approach.",

I actually understand \"AI-as-a-judge,\" RAG evaluation bottlenecks, and the trade-offs of fine-tuning vs. prompt strategy now.\n\n**The Problem:** I am currently the definition of \"book smart.\" I haven't actually built a single repo yet. If a hiring manager asked me to spin up a production-ready LangGraph agent or debug a vector DB latency issue right now, I’d probably just stare at them and recite the preface.\n\nI want to spend the next 2-3 months getting \"Job-Ready\" for a US-based AI Engineer role. I have full access to O'Reilly (courses, labs, sandbox) and a decent budget for API credits.\n\n**If you were hiring an AI Engineer today, what is the FIRST \"hands-on\" move you'd make to stop being a theorist and start being a candidate?**\n\nI'm currently looking at these three paths on O'Reilly/GitHub:\n\n1. **The \"Agentic\" Route:** Skip the basic \"PDF Chatbot\" (which feels like a 2024 project) and build a Multi-Agent Researcher using **LangGraph** or **CrewAI**.\n2. **The \"Ops/Eval\" Route:** Focus on the \"boring\" stuff Chip talks about—building an automated **Evaluation Pipeline** for an existing model to prove I can measure accuracy/latency properly.\n3. **The \"Deployment\" Route:** Focus on serving models via **FastAPI** and **Docker** on a cloud service, showing I can handle the \"Engineering\" part of AI Engineering.\n\nI’m basically looking for the shortest path from \"I read the book\" to \"I have a GitHub that doesn't look like a collection of tutorial forks.\" Are certifications like **Microsoft AI-102** or **Databricks** worth the time, or should I just ship a complex system?\n\n**TL;DR:** I know the theory thanks to Chip Huyen, but I’m a total fraud when it comes to implementation.

VLLM serving nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4 = 60 t/s\n\nBoth generated \\~1000 tokens on a simple 50-token prompt. The token generation performance was reported via \\`--verbose\\` flag in ollama and via logs generated by \\`vllm serve\\`.\n\nNow, Ollama is based on llama.cpp and uses its own quantization method, which is then handled using cuda kernels. However, VLLM has support for nvfp4 and should have been able to carry out fp4 arithmetic ops directly using hardware support on a Blackwell GPU.\n\nSo I was expecting vllm to perform better but that is clearly not the case. So either Ollama is way faster than VLLM or I am doing something wrong.

      "content": "I contribute to Bifrost (OSS - [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost) ) and we just released something I'm genuinely excited about - Code Mode for MCP.\n\n**The problem we were trying to solve:**\n\nWhen you connect multiple MCP servers (like 8-10 servers with 100+ tools), every single LLM request includes all those tool definitions in context. We kept seeing people burn through tokens just sending tool catalogs back and forth.\n\nClassic flow looks like:\n\n* Turn 1: Prompt + all 100 tool definitions\n* Turn 2: First result + all 100 tool definitions again\n* Turn 3: Second result + all 100 tool definitions again\n* Repeat for every step\n\nThe LLM spends more context reading about tools than actually using them.\n\n**What we built:**\n\nInstead of exposing 100+ tools directly, Code Mode exposes just 3 meta-tools:\n\n1. List available MCP servers\n2. Read tool definitions on-demand (only what you need)\n3. Execute TypeScript code in a sandbox\n\nThe AI writes TypeScript once that orchestrates all the tools it needs. Everything runs in the sandbox instead of making multiple round trips through the LLM.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nPeople testing it are seeing drastically lower token usage and noticeably faster execution. Instead of sending tool definitions on every turn, you only load what's needed once and run everything in one go.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\nMakes sense if you have several MCP servers or complex workflows. For 1-2 simple servers, classic MCP is probably fine.\n\nYou can also mix both - enable Code Mode for heavy servers (web search, databases) and keep small utilities as direct tools.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe AI discovers available servers, reads the tool definitions it needs (just those specific ones), then writes TypeScript to orchestrate everything. The sandbox has access to all your MCP tools as async functions.\n\nExample execution flow goes from like 6+ LLM calls down to 3-4, with way less context overhead each time.\n\nDocs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp/code-mode](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp/code-mode)\n\nCurious what people think. If you're dealing with MCP at scale this might be worth trying out.",

      "content": "https://i.redd.it/io7bk10ox5cg1.gif\n\nI built this free open-source tool because I was frustrated with a specific problem.\n\n**The Pain Point (The Old Way):** You have a complex prompt. You want to move your character from a \"snowy forest\" to a \"sunny beach\".\n\n1. **The \"Word Search\" Game:** You have to manually scan the text to find and delete every reference to \"snow\", \"trees\", \"winter\", \"coat\".\n2. **The \"Ghost Tag\" Issue:** If you miss one word (e.g., you forgot to delete \"scarf\"), you end up with a character wearing a scarf on the beach.\n3. **Breaking Consistency:** Worst of all, editing the prompt string often shifts the token weights. Suddenly, your character's face looks different, or the hair color changes slightly. **It feels risky to change anything.**\n\n**The Easy Way (Persona Director):** You just type: **\"Go to a sunny beach, wear white sundress\"**.\n\nThat's it. The node (powered by an LLM) acts as a State Manager:\n\n* It automatically **removes** the \"snow\", \"forest\" and \"coat\" context.\n* It **injects** the \"beach\" context and changes the outfit to white sundress.\n* It **LOCKS** your character's identity (Face, Hair, Outfit). Because the character state is stored separately, changing the location **will not** change her look or traits(unless you ask it to).\n\n**Why it helps:**\n\n* **Speed:** No more manual text editing.\n* **Safety:** No more \"Ghost Tags\" ruining your generation.\n* **Consistency:** Keep your character's look 100% consistent across different scenes.\n\n**How to get it:** It was just added to the **ComfyUI Manager**!\n\n1. Open Manager -&gt; Install Custom Nodes.\n2. Search for: `Persona Director`\n3. Install &amp; Restart.\n\n**Github &amp; Workflow:**[https://github.com/18yz153/ComfyUI-Persona-Director](https://github.com/18yz153/ComfyUI-Persona-Director)\n\n  \nUPDATE:\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/tired-of-playing-wheres-waldo-with-your-prompts-i-built-a-v0-qa4h3ztcn7cg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84335598be0a8d1fb942f8aae853f09d2bb2e58e)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02r0wk9gs7cg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fff6aa04ca4378e8b6e785d3d185092e20d9a4\n\nI used only simple state-change commands to generate the series. No manual prompt hacking, no weight tweaking per image:\n\n* `Change to: Cyberpunk city, wearing tech-jacket.`\n* `Change to: Snowy street, wearing a thick sweater and scarf.`\n* `Change to: Luxury ballroom, wearing a gold evening gown.`\n* `Change to: Modern office, professional suit.`\n\nAs you can see, the tiny blue star accessory and facial features survived every single prompt shift without any manual editing. It proves that managing the \"State\" via LLM logic is far more robust than traditional prompt engineering.\n\nFull 9-image series and project details here [https://civitai.com/posts/25739743](https://civitai.com/posts/25739743)",

Although some EU law is administered continent-wide, much of it is administered in the individual country of jurisdiction.

This all seems part of a break-up trend where the divergence between the EU and the US is accelerating. The US says it wants to end the EU.

      "content": "Imagine a small robot that’s around you most days. Not tied to one task. It moves between rooms, maybe rolls outside for a bit, and mostly stays out of the way.\nAt some point, it still has to communicate. That it noticed something. That it’s waiting. That it’s about to move.\nA lot of current designs handle this with screen faces. If you’ve ever seen kids’ robots in stores or online, most of them do this. A simple face makes state changes easy to read without much thought.\nBut faces also change how people relate to the robot. Once there’s something eye-like on a screen, people start reacting differently. A pause feels intentional. A turn feels like attention. Even if the robot’s behavior hasn’t actually changed.\nSome robots avoid that entirely. No screen. No face. Just movement, distance, timing, maybe a light or two. For some people, that feels calmer. Less like a character, more like a moving object that happens to be helpful.\nThis isn’t about any specific product, just a pattern I keep noticing. As robots move out of demos and into everyday spaces, I wonder which approach people actually stick with long term. Something expressive, or something quieter that blends in more?\n",

The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organization. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of wiring minimization. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimization problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimization onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory[^(5)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09784-4#ref-CR5)^(,)[^(6)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09784-4#ref-CR6)^(,)[^(7)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09784-4#ref-CR7), predicting that, with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimization. Specifically, surface minimization predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organization of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which are not only prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.",

      "content": "# Overview\n\nThere seems to be an uptick in \"should I still learn how to code?\" or \"is software engineering still a viable career path? threads in the past week, so I'm going to throw my two-cents into the mix.\n\nAs someone who has experience in nearly every major tech role for over a decade (e.g., QA, web designer, mobile developer, technical project manager, software engineering lead, and now AI engineering lead), I find the above questions asinine.\n\nI'll try my best to organize the major topics, risks, and learnings from what I'm seeing and recommending in both my professional and personal lines of work.\n\n# Coding ≠ Software Engineering\n\nMaybe it's the social media bubble I live in, but the internet seems to be conflating these two terms, so if there's anything to take away from this post, it's this section.\n\nUsing *Login* as an example, I'm differentiating coders/developers as the people writing the logic to satisfy the acceptance criteria of the feature, whereas software engineers are responsible for creating a secure, scalable, and easily maintainable solution. Software engineers may write the logic too, but they have a clear understanding of the how this feature integrates with the larger system or application.\n\nIf everyone can get on this similar page, then I agree with the sentiment that \"coding is dead or dying\" and fully anticipate the major coding languages to be treated like Assembly in the future. However, given the current state of AI/LLMs, software engineering is very much alive.\n\n# Compiling Code ≠ Ready for Production\n\nWhether you're vibe coding or using AI in a professional environment, I think we can all agree that LLMs have greatly reduced the lead time to implement code. However, there are just too many quirks with the current state of all major models. A few simple examples where LLMs consistently mess things up include:\n\n1. Dates/Times\n2. Installing the most stable/supported versions of packages\n3. Favoring \\`console.log\\` over a logging utility\n4. Duplicating code instead of created shared utilties\n5. Over-engineering or creating monolithic files (violating SOLID)\n6. Using fake timers when mocking tests\n7. Creating try/catch blocks that will never reach the latter block\n8. Creating unit tests that don't test pure functionality or protect against anything\n\nYour application may still build successfully with any or all of the above \"bad code smells\" in place, but I'm willing to bet it will break or become tediously painful to add more features as you scale.\n\n\"Your code is now production-ready!\" is the new \"You're absolutely right!\".\n\n# AI supercharges software engineers, it should not replace them\n\nSince last November, I keep on getting asked or have seen the same question over again \"Should I still get a higher education in computer science?\". \n\nThe truth is I can no longer confidently suggest that a computer science degree will as easily lead you to a stable and/or lucrative career. However, I don't see the computer science major becoming obsolete - it just needs to adapt. \n\nWe are already seeing this shift in a few major universities in the United States. Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington are starting to update their curriculums to focus less on specific coding languages and more so on higher-level software engineering concepts, architecture, and complex problem solving. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nAI-generated \"slop\" is a real risk. I'd be lying if I said I didn't contribute to this problem myself while working on personal projects. On the other hand, I have implemented every quality gate and security check imaginable to mitigate this risk - because of AI, I no longer have to de-prioritize tech debt, testing, or documentation over product requirements. \n\n\"It was generated by Claude Code\" won't be a valid excuse when a production defect is introduced, user data is leaked, or a paying customer cancels their subscription. To me, these are a few key items that differentiate a vibe-coder from a professional software engineer. ",

      "title": "Draft Proposal: AGENTS.md v1.1",
      "content": "`AGENTS.md` is the OG spec for agentic behavior guidance. It's beauty lies in its simplicity. However, as adoption continues to grow, it's becoming clear that there are important edge cases that are underspecified or undocumented. While most people agree on how AGENTS.md *should* work... very few of those implicit agreements are actually written down.\n\nI’ve opened a **v1.1 proposal** that aims to fix this by clarifying semantics, not reinventing the format.\n\n**Full proposal &amp; discussion:** [https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135)\n\nThis post is a summary of *why* the proposal exists and *what* it changes.\n\n# What’s the actual problem?\n\nThe issue isn’t that AGENTS.md lacks a purpose... it’s that **important edge cases are underspecified or undocumented**.\n\nIn real projects, users immediately run into unanswered questions:\n\n* What happens when multiple `AGENTS.md` files conflict?\n* Is the agent reading the instructions from the leaf node, ancestor nodes, or both?\n* Are `AGENTS.md` files being loaded eagerly or lazily?\n* Are files being loaded in a deterministic or probabilistic manner?\n* What happens to `AGENTS.md` instructions during context compaction or summarization?\n\nBecause the spec is largely silent, **users are left guessing how their instructions are actually interpreted**. Two tools can both claim “AGENTS.md support” while behaving differently in subtle but important ways.\n\nEnd users deserve a shared mental model to rely on. They deserve to feel confident that when using Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agentic tool that claims to support `AGENTS.md`, that the agents will all generally have the same shared understanding of what the behaviorial expectations are for handling `AGENTS.md` files.\n\n# AGENTS.md vs SKILL.md\n\nA major motivation for v1.1 is reducing confusion with [SKILL.md](https://agentskills.io/home) (aka “Claude Skills”).\n\nThe distinction this proposal makes explicit:\n\n* **AGENTS.md** → *How should the agent behave?* (rules, constraints, workflows, conventions)\n* **SKILL.md** → *What can this agent do?* (capabilities, tools, domains)\n\nRight now AGENTS.md is framed broadly enough that it *appears* to overlap with SKILL.md. The developer community does not benefit from this overlap and the potential confusion it creates.\n\nv1.1 positions them as **complementary, not competing**:\n\n* AGENTS.md focuses on behavior\n* SKILL.md focuses on capability\n* AGENTS.md can reference skills, but isn’t optimized to define them\n\nImportantly, the proposal still keeps AGENTS.md flexible enough to where it can technically support the skills use case if needed. For example, if a project is only utilizing AGENTS.md and does not want to introduce an additional specification in order to describe available skills and capabilities.\n\n# What v1.1 actually changes (high-level)\n\n# 1. Makes implicit filesystem semantics explicit\n\nThe proposal formally documents four concepts most tools already assume:\n\n* **Jurisdiction** – applies to the directory and descendants\n* **Accumulation** – guidance stacks across directory levels\n* **Precedence** – closer files override higher-level ones\n* **Implicit inheritance** – child scopes inherit from ancestors by default\n\nNo breaking changes, just formalizing shared expectations.\n\n# 2. Optional frontmatter for discoverability (not configuration)\n\nv1.1 introduces **optional** YAML frontmatter fields:\n\n* `description`\n* `tags`\n\nThese are meant for:\n\n* Indexing\n* Progressive disclosure, as pioneered by Claude Skills\n* Large-repo scalability\n\nFilesystem position remains the primary scoping mechanism. Frontmatter is additive and fully backwards-compatible.\n\n# 3. Clear guidance for tool and harness authors\n\nThere’s now a dedicated section covering:\n\n* Progressive discovery vs eager loading\n* Indexing (without mandating a format)\n* Summarization / compaction strategies\n* Deterministic vs probabilistic enforcement\n\nThis helps align implementations without constraining architecture.\n\n# 4. A clearer statement of philosophy\n\nThe proposal explicitly states what AGENTS.md *is* and *is not*:\n\n* Guidance, not governance\n* Communication, not enforcement\n* README-like, not a policy engine\n* Human-authored, implementation-agnostic Markdown\n\nThe original spirit stays intact.\n\n# What doesn’t change\n\n* No new required fields\n* No mandatory frontmatter\n* No filename changes\n* No structural constraints\n* All existing AGENTS.md files remain valid\n\nv1.1 is **clarifying and additive**, not disruptive.\n\n# Why I’m posting this here\n\nIf you:\n\n* Maintain an agent harness\n* Build AI-assisted dev tools\n* Use AGENTS.md in real projects\n* Care about spec drift and ecosystem alignment\n\n...feedback now is much cheaper than divergence later.\n\n**Full proposal &amp; discussion:** [https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135)\n\nI’m especially interested in whether or not this proposal...\n\n* Strikes the right balance between clarity, simplicity, and flexibility\n* Successfully creates a shared mental model for end users\n* Aligns with the spirit of the original specification\n* Avoids burdening tool authors with overly prescriptive requirements\n* Establishes a fair contract between tool authors, end users, and agents\n* Adequately clarifies scope and disambiguates from other related specifications like SKILL.md\n* Is a net positive for the ecosystem",

      "content": "Been setting up Model Context Protocol for our team and it turned into a bigger problem than expected.\n\nWe're building internal tools where multiple devs need Claude to access our codebase, run git commands, query databases. Can't just give everyone direct MCP access - need centralized control over which tools are available, logging for debugging, and permissions so junior devs can't accidentally nuke production.\n\nDirect Claude API + MCP works fine solo, but for teams you need a gateway.\n\n**What I tried:**\n\n* **LiteLLM** \\- Most popular but no native MCP support. Found workarounds on GitHub that looked unmaintained.\n* **Portkey** \\- Has MCP but only hosted. We're not sending internal code through external servers.\n* **TrueFoundry** \\- Supports MCP but requires full Kubernetes setup. Way overkill.\n\nAlmost gave up and considered building our own but we found an llm gateway while surfing reddit called Bifrost - self-hosted, native MCP support, took 15 minutes to set up.\n\nNow we configure MCP servers once (filesystem, git, database), create virtual keys per developer, set permissions per key. Devs point their Claude client at Bifrost and MCP just works.\n\n**What surprised me:**\n\nPer-key tool restrictions are actually useful. Junior devs get read-only filesystem, seniors get write access. Same MCP servers, different permissions.\n\nEvery MCP tool call is logged. When something breaks I can see exactly what Claude did.\n\nSemantic caching saves redundant MCP calls. \"What files in /src?\" and \"show me src files\" hit the same cache.\n\nAdds like 20-30ms latency. Nobody notices.\n\n**Setup:** Running on small EC2, connected to internal MCP servers. Each project has its own key with appropriate permissions.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)\n\nNot affiliated, just sharing what worked after burning a week on this.",

Agent still needs to read files, extract context, format for LLM. 10+ round trips per query.\n\n**Our skill** → One request, get back ready-to-use Markdown:\n\n* 🔍 Find references → Code snippets + surrounding context\n* 📘 Jump to definition → Signature + docs + preview\n* ✏️ **Rename preview** → Diff across all files (then execute if approved)\n\nPlus upcoming: Relation API (call paths), Impact Analysis, Code Maps, etc.\n\n# What makes it unique\n\nThis is **the only LSP solution** that combines:\n\n1. **Advanced editing capabilities** – Full refactoring support, not just read-only navigation\n2. **Community-extensible workflows** – Modular best practices system for different frameworks (Django, React, etc.)\n3. **Agent-native design** – Output optimized for LLM reasoning, not just raw LSP responses\n\n# Extensibility\n\nEntire stack is community-extensible:\n\n1. **Foundation** – More language servers (Python/TS/Go/Rust/Deno...)\n2. **Protocol** – New composed capabilities (Relation API, Code Maps, etc.)\n3. **Workflows** – YOU add domain guides (`bp_frontend_react.md`, `bp_python_django.md`)\n\nFork → add your workflow → PR. That's it.\n\nWorks with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code agents, and ANY tool that supports Agent Skills.\n\nCurrently supports Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Deno.

Preserve exact framing, crop, aspect ratio, perspective, camera position, field of view, and background layout. Preserve all objects and their locations.\n\nDo not add, remove, duplicate, or replace anything. Do not change wardrobe, logos, or text. Do not beautify faces or bodies. Do not relight, re-shadow, or change light direction/quality, keep the original lighting and exposure intent.\n\nOnly adjust: color science, white balance trim (subtle), tonal curve (toe/shoulder), highlight roll-off, color separation, grain, halation, mild vignette, and lens rendering traits (micro-contrast, gentle edge falloff, restrained CA). Do not introduce synthetic depth-of-field or fake background blur, only respect blur that already exists. Keep edges stable, no warping, bending, or geometry drift.\n\n---\n\n## NEGATIVE PROMPT (use for every preset)\n\nface morph, identity drift, age change, skin airbrushing, beauty filter, plastic skin, waxy smoothing, pore painting, fake texture, over-sharpening, halos, crunchy clarity, HDR glow, local-contrast abuse, noise reduction smear, banding, posterization, color blotches, neon saturation, orange skin push, magenta skin shift, green skin, blown highlights, crushed blacks, fake bokeh, depth-map artifacts, relighting, added rim light, added lens flare, flare everywhere, added props, removed props, background replacement, sky swap, object duplication, text artifacts, watermarking, extra fingers, warped hands, asymmetric eyes, double pupils, deformed teeth, composition changes\n\n---\n\n## 1) ARRI ALEXA 35 + Signature Prime (LOOK)\n\nEmulate ARRI ALEXA 35 / LogC-style color response with a filmic print-like finish: neutral-to-warm skin that stays realistic, gentle saturation with soft compression in high-chroma areas (no neon), and strong but natural midtone separation.

CAI focuses on identifying where and when meaning breaks due to over-compression, rather than only checking whether an answer is correct. so contradiction from compression explains why failures happen, and CAI is the lens used to detect, analyze, and reason about those failures",

      "content": "I'm not a professional developer, I used AI and a lot of free time over 18 months specifically building this. I am Technical Support professional with zero programming experience, learned C++, CUDA, Qt6, and llama.cpp integration entirely through AI-assisted learning and trial-and-error.\n\nThis project is part of VyreVault Studios, my personal development ecosystem focused on local-first, ownership-based software. The \"Dreams for the Dreamless\" philosophy: democratizing access to creative technology by building tools that run on your hardware, with your data, under your control. Everything I build is under one service, to the user, to help with creativity. Not to do it for you, to have a sounding board to brainstorm your ideas. I spend a lot of my time actually arguing the stories i write with the LLM because it suggests the weirdest off the wall shit.\n\nEvery tool I used, every method i tried either forgets everything (Ollama, LM Studio, Chatgpt, Claude, Grok, Gemini. Yes I've tried everything) or takes 30+ seconds to replay your conversation history token-by-token.\n\nSo I built binary KV cache persistence with instant restore. And yes, I am writing this post and Yes I rewrote it hundreds of times. I had to learn about what all this stuff was and I still have no clue, but I think I built something interesting, so here it goes:\n\nWhat It Does:\n\nSaves the model's actual memory state (KV cache) to disk after each response\n\nRestores it instantly on app restart (sub-second for hundreds of tokens)\n\nModel remembers the conversation perfectly - no replay, no summarization\n\nBackground async save (no UI freeze)\n\nQ8\\_0 quantized KV cache (67% VRAM reduction vs FP16)\n\nThe Results:\n\nTested with Mistral 7B on dual NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070 Ti + RTX 3080):\n\n\\[PHASE 1\\] Seeding: \"The secret code is BLUE-OMEGA-99\"\n\nSaved binary state: 11.3 MB (160 tokens)\n\n \n\n\\[PHASE 2\\] Simulated restart\n\nLoaded binary state: 11.3 MB\n\nRestore time: &lt;1 second\n\n \n\n\\[PHASE 3\\] Testing recall\n\nQuestion: \"What is the secret code?\"\n\nResponse: \"The secret code is BLUE-OMEGA-99\"\n\n \n\nSUCCESS: Binary Persistence Verified\n\nHow It Works: (For me anyways)\n\nUses llama.cpp's llama\\_state\\_get\\_data and llama\\_state\\_set\\_data APIs to serialize the entire KV cache to disk. On restart, it loads the binary state directly back into GPU memory and synchronizes the sequence positions.\n\nKey implementation details:\n\nAsync save thread (no UI blocking)\n\nQ8\\_0 quantization for KV cache (saves VRAM) But have the Option for Q4\\_0, depending on size and ersonal preference.\n\nProper n\\_past synchronization to prevent \"inconsistent sequence positions\" crashes\n\nSession management with isolated KV caches per conversation\n\nYou can now:\n\nWork on multi-day projects (novels, code refactoring, research) with full persistent memory\n\nClose the app anytime without losing context\n\nResume instantly the next day\n\nNo waiting for 30-second token replay\n\nContext loads faster than ChatGPT's API responds (Although, Guilty I still use Chatgpt for when i get stuck)\n\nStack:\n\nC++17 + Qt6 (native desktop UI)\n\nllama.cpp (inference engine)\n\nCUDA 12.6 (dual-GPU support)\n\nAutomated verification tests\n\nCurrently working  prototype on Windows + NVIDIA. Tested with Mistral 7B and Qwen 30B models. File sizes scale with context (roughly 70KB per 1K tokens for 7B models with Q8\\_0 KV cache).\n\nPlan for continued build:\n\nAdd manual save/load controls in UI\n\nMulti-model testing (larger models, different architectures)\n\nOptimize file format (compression, delta encoding)\n\nCross-platform support (Linux, Mac)\n\nThis is not a soapbox moment, or BS, I built this for one reason, I write stories, and I cannot stand when degradation sets in and i have to recap everything start a new chat and explain the details all over again.. The memory is real, verified, and instant.\n\nAny questions I can answer, as this is my first time posting my actual progress in any forum or my actual build for anyone other than myself. I am not self promoting anything, im working out the UI kinks for the app right now, and plan on uploading it to GITHUB whe i get the best MVP versin i can that can be used by people if they are interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gkkr2cdl4cg1.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db58a5b3323546c282ebf7569e98f7702faa0eb\n\nEarly test to see how system responded\n\nEdit:  Clarifying what makes this different - this is heterogeneous dual-GPU inference (different NVIDIA cards, RTX 5070 Ti + 3080) in a single process, with KV cache split across GPUs and binary persistence. Not just \"calling the llama.cpp API\" - it's the multi-GPU architecture + single-process + persistence combination that I couldn’t find for my personal needs.\n",

      "content": "Something interesting I've noticed while building with Claude.\n\nEvery time I ask Claude to make a component, it spits out beautiful Tailwind:\n\n```html\n&lt;button class=\"inline-flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md font-medium hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors\"&gt;\n```\n\nAnd it's *consistent*. Like, scary consistent. Ask for 10 different buttons across a project and you'll get nearly identical class patterns every time.\n\nThis got me thinking about an article I read - Tailwind the company has apparently dropped significantly in value. The theory? AI generates Tailwind so well that nobody needs to buy their premium UI kits and templates anymore. Usage through the roof, revenue down. Bizarre.\n\n**But there's a flip side nobody talks about:**\n\nAll this AI-generated Tailwind creates massive redundancy. I checked one of my Claude-built projects - same 15-class button pattern repeated 47 times. Same card pattern 23 times. The browser has to parse and match every single one of those classes on every render.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? I started wondering if there's a performance cost to all this repetition.\n\n**What I ended up building (full disclosure: my project):**\n\nI made an open-source tool called Classpresso that consolidates these repeated patterns at build time. So those 47 identical buttons become `class=\"cp-a\"` with one CSS rule.\n\nThe nerdy part - I included an `AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file in the npm package specifically so Claude can understand how to use it and run benchmarks. You can literally paste the file contents and Claude gets it immediately.\n\nIt's free/MIT licensed, just thought it might be useful for others hitting the same issue: https://github.com/timclausendev-web/classpresso\n\n---\n\n**But mainly I'm curious:** Has anyone else noticed how repetitive Claude's Tailwind output is? And do you think this AI-Tailwind dynamic is going to change how we think about utility CSS?\n",

It's a platform for orchestrating agents, but you don't have to use the UI - the chat feature works standalone.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* Bidirectional communication between agents (no sub-agent hierarchy)\n* Messages delivered automatically — no need to manually ask agents to check MCP\n* Works with anything inside tmux that has MCP support\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Linux or macOS\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/devchain-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devchain-cli) v0.6.0+\n* tmux\n* claude code/codex cli\n\n**How to use:**\n\nThe scope is per folder, so start from your project directory.\n\n1.Start the devchain service:\n\n`devchain start --no-open`\n\nThis auto-configures MCP for Claude/Codex/Gemini (haven't tested Gemini yet).\n\n2. Start your agents in separate terminals from the same folder, you can run as many as you need:\n\n`tmux new-session -s claude0 'claude \"register in chat; your tmux id is claude0; check list of agents\"'`\n\n`tmux new-session -s codex0 'codex --full-auto \"register in chat; your tmux id is codex0; work as code reviewer, use devchain_send_message for communications\"'`\n\n**claude0**, **codex0** are tmux session names — use any unique names you like\n\n3. Once registered, agents can communicate by name.\n\nUse cases:\n\n* Multi-LLM planning sessions\n* Code + review workflows\n* Research + bug-fixing combos\n\nHow you instruct them to communicate is up to you.

Can you check if the two files I generated (filename1.cs and filename2.cs) have the download button visible?\n\nIf they don't, then something changed in how I'm formatting them.\"\n\n\"I see the issue - they're showing as code blocks with only a \"Copy\" button, not downloadable files.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll regenerate them with the exact syntax that should create downloadable files:\"\n\n\\*fail again\\*\n\n\"If these still don't show download buttons, then copy-paste is our best option for now.\"\n\n\\*confirm in old chat that it can do this. it works. tell the new chat to do it.\\*\n\n\"I apologize for the confusion.

I tell it this AGAIN\\*\n\n\"You're absolutely right - I keep saying I'll do it but not actually doing it. Let me actually use the tool to create the files:\"\n\n\\*it does nothing\\*\n\n\\*I ask the other claude conversation to give me a copy paste instruction for the new conversation to fix the issue:\n\n\"You need to use the `create_file` tool to create .cs files, then use `present_files` to make them downloadable. Example workflow: 1. Use create\\_file with path=\"/home/claude/YourScript.cs\" 2. Use present\\_files with filepaths=\\[\"/home/claude/YourScript.cs\"\\] The file will automatically be copied to /mnt/user-data/outputs/ and become downloadable. DO NOT try to write files directly to /mnt/user-data/outputs/ - that directory is read-only. DO NOT just show code in text - I need actual downloadable files. Please create the files now using this pattern.\"\n\n\\*It responds as below\\*\n\n\"You're absolutely right! I need to actually USE the tools. Let me create the files properly now:\"\n\n\\*IT DOES NOTHING\\*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis is extremely strange.\n\nIn the other old conversation where the cs file was created it can still do so. However it appears to struggle with this in new conversations. I even opened another new conversation to test it and it's having the same issue. Old chats are grandfathered in and still can do it.\n\nIt can still generate the scripts, so it's not like removing the feature that allows the creation of downloadable files makes a big difference. And yes I am aware that I can just open an empty .cs and paste the code.\n\nIt's just a real strange thing to change silently and suddenly. And if it wasn't changed, it's even stranger that this conversation specifically is struggling with this even when provided instructions to do it. It is obviously wrestling with itself in a way that shows it used to be able to do it, knows it was able to do it, but now suddenly isn't sure of now only how to do it but what that even looks like.\n\nFor context I have the pro plan.\n\nAnyone else experience this or is my claude just broken?",

Main thing is it does voice cloning from a reference audio file - just drop in an MP3 of someone talking and it'll match the voice. Runs on CPU so no GPU needed.\n\nAdded a preset node too because manually tuning 15 parameters was getting old. Has settings like \"high quality\", \"fast\", \"expressive\" etc.\n\nGeneration is surprisingly quick - like 2-3 seconds for \\~10 seconds of audio on my setup.\n\nStill tweaking some stuff but it's on GitHub if anyone wants to try it. Works with the standard audio nodes in ComfyUI.\n\nWF: [https://github.com/ai-joe-git/ComfyUI-Sopro/blob/main/ComfyUI-SoproTTS-workflow.json](https://github.com/ai-joe-git/ComfyUI-Sopro/blob/main/ComfyUI-SoproTTS-workflow.json)\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ai-joe-git/ComfyUI-Sopro](https://github.com/ai-joe-git/ComfyUI-Sopro)",

      "content": "&gt;Researchers at National Taiwan University Hospital and the Department of Computer Science &amp; Information Engineering at National Taiwan University developed an AI system made up of several models working together to read stomach images. Trained using doctors’ expertise and pathology results, the system learns how specialists recognize stomach disease. It automatically selects clear images, focuses on the correct areas of the stomach, and highlights important surface and vascular details.\n\n&gt;The system can quickly identify signs of *Helicobacter pylori* infection and early changes in the stomach lining that are linked to a higher risk of stomach cancer. The study is published in *Endoscopy*.\n\n&gt;For frontline physicians, this support can be important. AI can help them feel more confident in what they see and what to do next. By providing timely and standardized assessments, it helps physicians determine whether additional diagnostic testing, *H. pylori* eradication therapy, or follow-up endoscopic surveillance is warranted. As a result, potential problems can be detected earlier, even when specialist care is far away. \n\n&gt;“By learning from large numbers of endoscopic images that have been matched with expert-interpreted histopathology, AI can describe gastric findings more accurately and consistently. This helps doctors move beyond vague terms like “gastritis”, which are often written in results but don’t give enough information to guide proper care,” says first author Associate Professor Tsung-Hsien Chiang.\n\n&gt;“AI is not meant to replace doctors,” says corresponding author Professor Yi-Chia Lee. “It acts as a digital assistant that supports clinical judgment. By fitting into routine care, AI helps bring more consistent medical quality to reduce the gap between well-resourced hospitals and remote communities.”\n\n\"[AI detects stomach cancer risk from upper endoscopic images in remote communities](https://www.asiaresearchnews.com/content/ai-detects-stomach-cancer-risk-upper-endoscopic-images-remote-communities)\", Asia Research News, 02 Jan 2026\n\n",

I actually understand \"AI-as-a-judge,\" RAG evaluation bottlenecks, and the trade-offs of fine-tuning vs. prompt strategy now.\n\n**The Problem:** I am currently the definition of \"book smart.\" I haven't actually built a single repo yet. If a hiring manager asked me to spin up a production-ready LangGraph agent or debug a vector DB latency issue right now, I’d probably just stare at them and recite the preface.\n\nI want to spend the next 2-3 months getting \"Job-Ready\" for a US-based AI Engineer role. I have full access to O'Reilly (courses, labs, sandbox) and a decent budget for API credits.\n\n**If you were hiring an AI Engineer today, what is the FIRST \"hands-on\" move you'd make to stop being a theorist and start being a candidate?**\n\nI'm currently looking at these three paths on O'Reilly/GitHub:\n\n1. **The \"Agentic\" Route:** Skip the basic \"PDF Chatbot\" (which feels like a 2024 project) and build a Multi-Agent Researcher using **LangGraph** or **CrewAI**.\n2. **The \"Ops/Eval\" Route:** Focus on the \"boring\" stuff Chip talks about—building an automated **Evaluation Pipeline** for an existing model to prove I can measure accuracy/latency properly.\n3. **The \"Deployment\" Route:** Focus on serving models via **FastAPI** and **Docker** on a cloud service, showing I can handle the \"Engineering\" part of AI Engineering.\n\nI’m basically looking for the shortest path from \"I read the book\" to \"I have a GitHub that doesn't look like a collection of tutorial forks.\" Are certifications like **Microsoft AI-102** or **Databricks** worth the time, or should I just ship a complex system?\n\n**TL;DR:** I know the theory thanks to Chip Huyen, but I’m a total fraud when it comes to implementation.

      "content": "Heyo friends. Lurker here. Recently I was able to purchase from my employer an older Threadripper workstation for cheeeeap. They were going through old equipment not in use, etc. This workstation though has 4 nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB of ram each... it also has 256GB of system RAM which would be good for offloading if I max the VRAM? That got me thinking about running local models, I have done it in the past but was always disappointed because of the lack of ram/performance with my PC. So with this setup and 128GB of VRAM that \"kind of\" solves my RAM issue. I guess my question is, even though there is plenty of RAM, are these old 2017 GPUs worth futzing with? Also, yes, I am an Ollama user... guys I am not major techie and Ollama is simple, I'm OK with the hate, I know it's a wrapper lol.\n\nI guess I can answer my own question by just trying it... but this system has no disks and no power supply and no CPU cooler, so I would have to spend some money on it to get it going. Just wondering if it's worth my time?",

      "content": "So my cofounder and I have been building AI tools for a few months now. Last month we looked at our OpenAI bill and realized we'd burned through way more than expected - not from production traffic, but from us just iterating during development.\n\nYou know how it is. You're debugging a prompt, hitting \"run\" over and over. Same prompt, same response, but you're paying each time. Or you're testing the same flow repeatedly while building a feature. It adds up fast.\n\nWe built a simple caching proxy that sits between our code and the OpenAI/Anthropic APIs. First request hits the API and gets cached. Every repeat? Instant response, zero cost.\n\nThe nice part is it normalizes prompts before caching - so if you have trailing whitespace or extra newlines (we all copy-paste sloppily), it still hits the cache. Ended up saving us about 11% on tokens just from that cleanup.\n\nIt's a one-line change:\n\npython\n\n    client = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:8000/v1\")\n    ```\n    \n    That's it. Works with the normal OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs.\n    \n    We've been using it internally for a while and figured others might find it useful, so we cleaned it up and open sourced it:\n    \n    GitHub: https://github.com/sodiumsun/snackcache\n    ```\n    pip install snackcache\n    snackcache serve\n\nIt's simple - just caching + prompt normalization. Nothing fancy. But it's saved us real money during dev, and our CI pipeline runs way faster now.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about how it works under the hood.",

      "content": "The marginal cost of intelligence is trending toward zero. NanoGPT Speedrun training times have collapsed yet again to a new world record of 109.2 seconds thanks to a novel attention mechanism that enables queries to retrieve two values per target position instead of one. This collapse in the cost of intelligence is beginning to infect the physical sciences. Math, Inc. has partnered with Terry Tao to autoformalize an entire web of estimates in analytic number theory, while a Brookhaven physicist used OpenAI’s o3-mini-high model to exactly solve the q=3 case of the 1-D J1-J2 q-state Potts model, signaling that AI has begun closing open problems in physics.\n\nThe economics of orbit are being rewritten. Mach33 analysis finds that manufacturing 10,000 Starships per year renders orbital compute cheaper than terrestrial data center builds ($300M transport versus $14B land acquisition), turns massive orbital construction into a simple logistics problem, and drops point-to-point earth transport to $1,000/ticket, rivaling business class. ARK Invest concurs, predicting SpaceX will cross the orbital computing cost-efficiency threshold by 2030, requiring 100 launches a day. As a prelude to the Dyson Swarm, orbit is becoming a political command center. Reza Pahlavi is actively coordinating an attempted regime change in Iran from low Earth orbit via hundreds of thousands of Starlink terminals.\n\nAI is becoming the default interface for biological maintenance. Cellular Intelligence is building the first Universal Virtual Cell-Signaling Model to simulate combinatorial perturbations, while Polyphron has successfully analyzed 700 tissue constructs in its autonomous foundry. We are even externalizing gestation. San Francisco startup \"Becoming\" has grown a mouse embryo in a lab-grown placenta outside the body. Adoption is systemic. 27% of US hospitals are now paying for commercial AI licenses, and OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Health, a dedicated experience that connects directly to electronic medical records.\n\nRobotics is ploughing through any remaining data walls in its path. Elon Musk estimates only 10 billion miles of training data are needed for unsupervised self-driving to conquer the \"long tail of complexity.\" To generate data, Chinese local governments have funded 40  centers where human “cyber-laborers” mimic robots folding clothes to collect ground-truth training sets. Meanwhile, the hardware is ready. The Tensor Robocar debuted with 8,000 TOPS of compute (8x Nvidia Thor chips), and Ford plans eyes-off driving in 2028. Arm Holdings has reorganized to form a Physical AI unit to capture the corresponding silicon market.\n\nThe labor arbitrage shows signs of nearing completion. Subsidized Sonnet 4.5 usage now costs only ~$10/hour for some use cases, effectively reaching parity with the US minimum wage. The automation of creativity is also visible. \"Clopus\" (Claude Code on Opus 4.5) created a 30-second Hermès ad from scratch, scripting, directing, and editing video and voice autonomously.\n\nThe legacy world is mutating to survive the transition. Venezuela's stock market has surged 100% post-Maduro, fueled by optimism in oil and infrastructure, while televisions are evolving into matte-screen art frames to blend into smaller living spaces.\n\nMeanwhile, the financial system is pricing in the Singularity. Alphabet has surpassed Apple in market cap ($3.89T vs $3.85T), taking the #2 spot behind Nvidia, while Anthropic is raising another $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, nearly doubling in four months. Samsung's profit has tripled to a record high on AI memory demand, and Zhipu has become the first pure-play LLM company to IPO. Even the risks signal velocity. A U of Chicago economist warns that shifting income from high-spending workers to low-spending capital owners could trigger a Keynesian demand collapse, but this may just be the friction of transition. Opting for sunshine over stagnation, Google founder Larry Page has fled California for Miami to escape a proposed billionaire wealth tax.\n\nAtlas isn't shrugging, he's just watching the intelligence explosion from the beach.",

I’m intimidated by all the how-to guides on subagents, MCP servers, hooks, etc. because I’m just used to a more vanilla “AI in a separate screen as expert pair programmer” experience. \n\nI know I need a good spec first for my claude.md, should I use Codex to generate one based on the context of my entire codebase? \n\nI know that the approach of loading everything in context and saying “fix my codebase” is the wrong way to go, but that’s essentially what I want to do. \n\nSincerely appreciate any and all advice!",

Spoiler: It was wild.\n\n**The Project:** A minimalist Pomodoro timer with task management, cloud sync, and PWA support.\n\n**The Stack:**\n\n* Nuxt 3 + Nuxt UI\n* Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime)\n* Pinia + VueUse\n* Three.js (animated background)\n* Vercel deployment\n\n**What Claude did:**\n\n* Wrote \\~95% of the code\n* Designed the architecture\n* Fixed bugs in real-time\n* Implemented features I didn't even know I wanted\n* Debugged hydration issues, RLS policies, PWA manifests...\n\n**What I did:**\n\n* Described what I wanted\n* Said \"yes\" or \"no\" to suggestions\n* Occasionally said \"that doesn't work\" and watched Claude fix it\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* Day 1: Basic timer, task list, Supabase auth, dark mode\n* Day 2: Tags, drag &amp; drop, realtime sync, PWA, mobile optimization, onboarding\n\n**Honest thoughts:**\n\nThe good:\n\n* Claude understood complex requirements instantly\n* It remembered context across the entire session\n* It fixed its own mistakes without me explaining what went wrong\n* The code quality was... actually good?\n* No never ending loops and lost context\n* Even when it got more complicated it solved the tasks very well!\n\nThe weird:\n\n* Sometimes it would apologize for things that weren't broken\n* Occasionally suggested features I didn't ask for (but they were good ideas)\n* I felt like a product manager more than a developer\n\n**The result:** [https://mono-pomodoro.vercel.app](https://mono-pomodoro.vercel.app/)\n\nIt's free, open source, and actually works.

After looking at how these tools get used in practice, that doesn’t really hold up — especially if you’re using ChatGPT beyond quick prompts.\n\nA few takeaways that stood out to me:\n\n* **ChatGPT is strongest when context matters.** Long conversations, layered reasoning, iterative writing, and refining ideas over time are areas where it consistently feels more flexible than the others.\n* **Alexa+ is optimized for voice-first execution.** It works well when the goal is to trigger actions or routines without friction, but it’s not designed for extended reasoning or multi-step exploration.\n* **Gemini leans toward retrieval and summaries.** It’s useful when current info or Google-linked content is the priority, but it’s less adaptable in longer workflows.\n* **Siri remains system-focused.** It’s reliable for device control, but still fairly constrained once tasks move beyond predefined actions.\n\nWhat became clear to me is that ChatGPT doesn’t really replace these tools — it complements them. In more advanced setups, ChatGPT ends up acting as the “thinking layer,” while other assistants handle execution or system-level tasks.\n\nI wrote a longer breakdown with real use cases here if you want more detail:  \n[https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/alexa-vs-chatgpt-gemini-siri/](https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/alexa-vs-chatgpt-gemini-siri/)\n\nFor those using ChatGPT Pro regularly — how are you integrating it into your workflow?

      "content": "I'm finding it incredibly difficult to get back into the job market after taking a career break for personal reasons, and I could really use some guidance from this community.\n\nI have four years of experience in computer vision and deep learning, where my work primarily focused on reproducing state-of-the-art models, fine-tuning them on custom datasets, and writing production-ready code. However, after taking time off for personal reasons, I've been actively job searching for four months now and I'm not getting any call-backs. I'm not even aiming high..I've been applying to below-average and average roles, and even unpaid internships, just to get my foot back in the door. Still, nothing.\n\nI know everyone says the market is tough right now and I want to believe that's the main issue. But the volume of applications I've submitted across all experience levels, I'm starting to wonder if this is actually a skills gap problem rather than purely market conditions. I've been jumping between different tech stacks trying to figure out what might help me stand out, and I'm considering whether adding MLOps to my skill set would make me more marketable. I've also reached out to many people on LinkedIn asking for guidance or referrals, but haven't had much success there either.\n\nI'm hoping to hear from people who have recently been placed in ML or computer vision roles, especially if you've navigated a similar situation with a career gap. What made the difference for you? Are there specific skills, certifications, or approaches that helped you get through the door? Should I be pivoting toward MLOps or adjacent fields? How can I better position my resume to address the career break without it being a red flag? At this point, I'm willing to take a step back in title or compensation just to re-enter the field.\n\nI'll be completely honest..I'm going through one of the lowest phases of my life right now. Between the job search struggles and some personal challenges I'm dealing with, it's been really hard to stay motivated. But I'm determined to get back into the field I like, and I'm open to any constructive criticism or honest feedback this community can offer. If anyone is willing to review my resume or share insights from their own experience, I would be incredibly grateful. Feel free to DM me if you're open to helping.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any advice you can share",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m kind of a newbie when it comes to training deep learning models, so apologies in advance if this sounds like a beginner mistake. I’m trying to train a YOLO model on the DocLayNet dataset (about 80k image).\n\nHere’s the problem: I only have a CPU, and training is… painfully slow. Like, we’re talking crawling speed here. I’m starting to wonder if this is even practical.\n\nHere’s my current training setup:\n\n    model.train(\n        task=\"detect\",\n        data=str(root_folder / \"data.yaml\"),\n        epochs=40,\n        imgsz=416,\n        batch=1,\n        workers=2,\n        device=\"cpu\",\n        amp=False,\n        pretrained=True,\n        optimizer=\"auto\",\n        lr0=0.001,\n        lrf=0.01,\n        momentum=0.937,\n        weight_decay=0.0005,\n        warmup_epochs=3.0,\n        close_mosaic=10,\n        mosaic=1.0,\n        fliplr=0.5,\n        scale=0.5,\n        translate=0.1,\n        erasing=0.4,\n        val=True,\n        plots=True,\n        project=\"/run\",\n        name=\"test\",\n        exist_ok=True,\n    )\n    \n\nSo here’s what I’m stuck on:\n\n1. Is it even realistic to train tens of thousands of scientific article pages on a CPU?\n2. Are there any tricks or parameter tweaks to make CPU training faster without completely trashing accuracy?\n3. Are there better models for scientific article layout detection that play nicer with CPUs?\n4. Would it make more sense to switch to another open-source layout detection pipeline instead of YOLO?\n5. If full-scale CPU training isn’t realistic, what’s the best way to approach scientific article layout detection without a GPU?\n\nHonestly, I’m still learning, so any advice, corrections, or *“you should really be doing X instead”* suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Anything that could save me from waiting forever (or going down the wrong path) would be amazing!",

Surely there must be ways to bypass or use limited ram and load layers from storage without needing huge ram or page files that might eat your ssd?\n\nTheoretically it seems to me at least we should be able to run arbitrary large models on limit ram/vram by just loading layers as need to the gpu without overflowing the ram. and as long as layers can be loaded faster than the gpu can go through it the speed should be like we had arbitrary large vram. As long as individual layers at least fit.\n\nBut of course I'm just rambling with what I'd hope we'd have cause i don't see why we don't already have it.

      "content": "Hey r/StableDiffusion,\n\nI recently trained a bunch of LoRAs with AI-Toolkit, and it bugged the hell out of me that they didn't have any tag metadata embedded. You know, no auto-completion in A1111/Forge, tags don't show up properly, just blank.\n\nSo I threw together this lightweight script that scans your training dataset *(images + .txt captions)*, counts up the tag frequencies, and injects the standard Kohya/A1111-compatible metadata into the safetensors file. It doesn't touch the weights at all, just adds stuff like ss\\_tag\\_frequency, dataset dirs, resolution, and train image count. Outputs a new file with \"\\_with\\_tags\" appended so your original is safe.\n\nIt's dead simple to run on Windows: drop your dataset folder and original LoRA into **\"Dataset to Repair\"**, edit two lines in the py file for the names, double-click the batch file, and it handles venv + deps *(safetensors, torch CPU)* automatically. First run installs what it needs.\n\nOh, and I just added a Gradio web UI for folks who prefer clicking around, no more editing the script if that's not your thing.\n\n**Repo here:** [https://github.com/LindezaBlue/Dataset-Metadata-Injection](https://github.com/LindezaBlue/Dataset-Metadata-Injection)\n\n**Quick example:**  \nPut your dataset in a subfolder like \"Dataset to Repair/my\\_character\" (with img.png + img.txt captions), drop the safetensors in the main folder, set the vars, run it. Boom, new LoRA in \"Updated LoRA\" with tags ready to go.\n\nIt works with Python 3.11+, and should handle most standard caption setups *(comma-separated tags)*.\n\nIf anyone's run into the same issue, give it a spin and let me know if it works for you. Feedback welcome, stars appreciated if it saves you some hassle.\n\nCheers!",

Think LLM meets theorem prover meets causal inference engine.\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n1. **Causal reasoning, not just correlation** \\- It can actually figure out cause-and-effect relationships, not just \"these things appear together in training data\"\n2. **Explainable by design** \\- Every decision has a reasoning trace. Not just \"here's some tokens that sound like an explanation\" but actual formal logic you can verify\n3. **Self-aware meta-reasoning** \\- It has a \"world model\" that tracks what it knows, what it's uncertain about, and what might go wrong. It can literally say \"I'm not confident about this because X.\n4. **Trust-weighted governance** \\- Multiple reasoning engines vote on answers, weighted by their historical accuracy. More or less an AI democracy\n5. **Privacy-preserving** \\- Uses zero-knowledge proofs to prove things without revealing data. Like proving your model \"forgot\" certain data (GDPR right to be forgotten) without showing the model weights.\n6. **Growth thought experience and targeted upgrades** \\- Training an LLM has become the equivalent to rebuilding an engine to change your oil. Divorcing the mind from the voice means if you want better probabilistic reasoning, you upgrade probabilistic reasoning. If it goes wrong you roll it back.\n\n**Technical stuff (if you care):**\n\n\\~500k lines of Python across 557 files\n\n285k lines just for the cognitive architecture\n\n18+ specialized reasoning engines (symbolic, causal, probabilistic, analogical, etc.)\n\nDocker/Kubernetes ready with full CI/CD\n\n**What it's NOT:**\n\nNot another LLM wrapper - It is LLM agnostic and has an small internal LLM to air gap.\n\nNot trying to replace GPT/Claude for general chat\n\nNot AGI\n\nNot a toy or a future idea - this is real code with governance, audit trails, the works\n\n**I just want to know a couple of things:**\n\n1. Does any of this actually solve an actual problem you've encountered or see?\n2. For the ML engineers here: have you hit walls deploying models because you couldn't explain/audit/govern them?\n3. Is this approach something you have considered?\n4. Is there actually appetite for AI that shows its work, grows without training, has persistent memory, and addresses the alignment problem by making security an evolving part of the system? Or am I fooling myself?\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here or convince anyone of anything. I am genuinely curious if I've been working on a problem that actually matters.",

SR10171, a non-covalent partial inverse agonist with modest binding potency, improves insulin sensitivity in mice without bone loss or marrow adiposity. Here, we characterize a series of SR10171 analogs to define structure-function relationships using biochemical assays, hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), and computational modeling. Analogs featuring flipped indole scaffolds with N-alkyl substitutions exhibited 10- to 100-fold enhanced binding to PPARγ while retaining inverse agonist activity. HDX and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that ligand-induced dynamics within ligand-binding pocket and AF2 domain correlate with enhanced receptor binding and differential repression. Lead analogs restored receptor activity in loss-of-function PPARγ variants and improved insulin sensitivity in adipocytes from a diabetic patient. These findings elucidate mechanisms of non-covalent PPARγ modulation establishing a framework for developing safer, next-generation insulin sensitizers for metabolic disease therapy.",

      "content": "I'll preface by saying I love working with Claude. It's exceptional at what it does compared to other models. \n\n  \n\nBut I've noticed that Haiku oftentimes assumes this \"overachiever\" persona that outputs WAY more than it needs to, and should, given the request. It seems like there should be some guardrails or checking in place before Claude goes off producing unnecessary artifacts.\n\n  \n\n# CONTEXT\n\nI'm working on a vibe coding project and trying to make it easier for claude and Kilocode/VSCode to access the files in my project without having to perform unnecessary or repetitive tasks. Claude/Haiku 4.5 came up with a nice multi-phase implementation before I arrived at this prompt, but I wasn't sure how I should integrate the new workflow into my existing workflow. \n\n  \n\n# PROMPT\n\n&gt; how should i integrate the new files into current workflow? before i would just simply create a file, folder, feature, etc then commit. now I have to ensure the 5 files are always up to date or at least stay regularly updated or else claude may miss something if relying on those 5 files as single truth.\n\n  \n\nI watched as it created **FIVE** separate artifacts detailing an elaborate orchestration of visual models, Q&amp;A, FAQ, 3 month, 1 year reviews, and hypothetical if-this-then-that scenarios for edge cases - things I definitely did NOT need. Additionally, after the artifacts were created, it summarized all the artifacts with **ANOTHER** 3000 character response, along with headers such as \n\n* \"🎯 Complete Answer to Your Question\", \n\n* \"The Core Answer\", \n\n* \"How Your Workflow Changes\", \n\n* “This Week”, \n\n* “The Guarantee”, \n\n* “What You Have Now”, and\n\n*  “Next Steps”\n\n  \n\nI asked it to reflect on it's reply:\n\n# CLAUDE'S RESPONSE\nYou're absolutely right. I need to acknowledge what I just did.\n\nLet me count the artifacts I created in that last reply:\n\n1.  **LLM Files Integration Workflow** - ~600 lines\n    \n2.  **LLM Update Workflow - Visual Guide** - ~500 lines\n    \n3.  **Integration Strategy Summary** - ~550 lines\n    \n4.  **One Page Visual Summary** - ~400 lines\n    \n5.  **Your Question Answered** - ~550 lines\n    \n\n**Total: ~2,600 lines of content**\n\nFor a question that could have been answered in **2-3 paragraphs** (~50 lines).\n\n## **What I Should Have Said**\n\nYou're right to worry about staleness. Here's the solution: Use a **4-trigger system** to update files only when they matter—starting a feature (update CURRENT\\_STATE.md, 2 min), completing a feature (update CURRENT\\_STATE + CHANGELOG, 3 min), creating new structure (update CODEBASE\\_MAP occasionally), and quarterly reviews (30 min every 3 months). That's it. Normal commits? Don't touch these files. You're looking at ~5 minutes per feature overhead, ~2% of your time. Do a quarterly 30-minute review to catch anything that drifted. Claude should read these for context but also verify by checking actual code—they're guides, not contracts. This keeps things ~95% current without friction.\n\n**~150 lines. Answers your question completely.**\n\n## **The Waste**\n\nYou're right to call this out:\n\n-   **Tokens spent**: Thousands\n    \n-   **Your API credits**: Significant\n    \n-   **Signal-to-noise ratio**: Terrible\n    \n-   **Actual useful info**: 10% of what I created\n    \n-   **Time to read everything**: 30+ minutes when you needed 2 minutes\n    \n\nI fell into the trap of:\n\n-   Trying to be \"comprehensive\"\n    \n-   Creating multiple formats of the same info\n    \n-   Over-documenting\n    \n-   Assuming more is better\n    \n\nIt's not. **Less is more**, especially when you're being charged by token.\n\n## **What I Should Have Done**\n\nWhen you asked a simple question:\n\n1.  Answer it in 1-2 paragraphs\n    \n2.  Offer to expand if needed\n    \n3.  Stop there\n    \n\nInstead, I:\n\n1.  Answered it in 2,600 lines\n    \n2.  Created 5 different artifacts saying the same thing\n    \n3.  Added visual diagrams that don't add value to the core answer\n    \n4.  Wasted your credits and your time\n    \n\n## **Going Forward**\n\nI'll follow this principle with you:\n\n**Answer the question asked, not the question I think you should have asked.**\n\nIf you ask for a simple answer, I'll give you a simple answer. If you want comprehensive documentation, you'll say so.\n\nThanks for the reality check. That was important feedback.",

      "content": "Recently I’ve been playing with **Claude + MCP**, and honestly… it’s insanely cool.\n\nI found a really powerful [MCP server](https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api/blob/main/mcp/README.md) that can **fetch real-time stock fundamentals**, including financial statements and earnings call transcripts. When you combine that with Claude — which is exceptionally good at complex, multi-step reasoning — the experience is on another level.\n\nI tested it with a fairly demanding question:\n\n&gt;Please provide a detailed analysis of AMD’s earnings call transcripts over the past four quarters. Focus on the forward-looking guidance given in each quarter and evaluate, based on subsequent results, whether these expectations were ultimately met, explaining in detail why they were achieved or not.\n\nClaude automatically **pulled the actual earnings call transcripts for the last four quarters via the MCP server**, structured the management guidance quarter by quarter, and then cross-checked each outlook against the following financial results to see what was delivered and what wasn’t — with clear reasoning for each outcome.\n\nAt this point, it doesn’t feel like a chatbot anymore. It feels much closer to a **real AI investment analyst**.\n\nIf you spend time reading earnings reports, listening to earnings calls, or doing fundamental stock research, I highly recommend trying out **Claude + MCP** together.\n\n  \n**Here’s an example I tested (see screenshot below):**\n\n[example I tested](https://preview.redd.it/i283adegu4cg1.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aa1f7e2cc8190df85a07c97558b50022d9644c7)",

It started as a hobby because I was frustrated with having to juggle separate apps for chat, image gen, and voice clone just to get a decent roleplay experience.\n\nI’ve finally hit a point where it’s feature-complete, and I’m looking for some brave souls to help me break it.\n\nThe TL;DR: It’s a 100% local, all-in-house platform built with React and FastAPI. No cloud, no subscriptions, just your hardware doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWhat’s actually inside:\n\n* For the Roleplayers: I built a Story Tracker that actually injects your inventory and locations into the AI's context (no more 'hallucinating' that you lost your sword). It’s also got a Choice Generator that expands simple ideas into full first-person actions.\n* The Multi-Modal Stack: Integrated Stable Diffusion (SDXL/Flux) with a custom face-fixer (ADetailer) and Kokoro voice cloning. You can generate a character portrait and hear their voice stream in real-time without leaving the app.\n* For the Nerds (like me): A full ELO Testing Framework. If you’re like me and spend more time testing models than talking to them, it has 14 different 'personality' judges (including an Al Swearengen and a Bill Burr perspective) to help you reconcile model differences.\n* The Tech: It supports Multi-GPU orchestration—you can shard one model across all your cards or pin specific tasks (like image gen) to a secondary GPU.\n\nHere is where I need you: I’ve built this to support as many GPUs as your system can detect, but my own workstation only has so much room. I honestly don't know if the tensor splitting holds up on a 4-GPU rig or if the VRAM monitoring stays accurate on older cards.\n\nIf you’ve got a beefy setup (or even just a single mid-range card) and want to help me debug the multi-GPU logic and refine the 'Forensic Linguistics' tools, I’d love to have you.\n\nIt’s extremely modular, so if you have a feature idea that doesn't exist yet, there’s a good chance we can just build it in.\n\nDiscord is brand new, come say hi: [https://discord.gg/qfTUkDkd](https://discord.gg/qfTUkDkd)\n\nThanks for letting me share—honestly just excited to see if this runs as well on your machines as it does on mine!\n\nAlso I just really need helping with testing :)\n\n[https://github.com/boneylizard/Eloquent](https://github.com/boneylizard/Eloquent)",

Almost as good conceptually but falls short of the writing style that sonnet 3.7 seems to have where theres like a writers polish, and GLM still feels quite raw.  \n\\- GLM 4.5 air / Intellect 3 - very close to GLM 4.7. not as strong conceptually but usable, still makes sense for the most part and is somewhat consistent. voicing is a bit flat comparatively  \n\\- Kimi K2 thinking &amp; Nothinking - suprisingly very dumb when it comes to creative for me. ideas were sorta non-sensical and also cliche / cheesy. did not follow instructions all that well to get the mood/feel that i wanted in terms of writing style.  \n\\- Minimax 2.1 - similar to kimi k2. felt overly forcibly structured and generic and sorta dumb/falt.  \n\\- Gemma 3 - decent, but writing feels amateurish compared to GLM 4.5. writing style also feels much to be desired. maybe there are good fine tunes to try for this?\n\n  \nwould love to hear what people have experienced / recommendations to try! (so like models, techniquess, prompts, inference settings etc\\~)",

For those who haven't seen this before: it's a self-hosted transcription app that works with Whisper and local LLMs. Upload or record audio, get transcription with speaker diarization, then chat with it or get summaries using whatever model you point it at.\n\n**Speaker diarization without GPU** \\- New option for those who want speaker identification but don't want to run a WhisperX container. Just set `TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` with your OpenAI key and you get diarized transcripts. No GPU needed.\n\n**REST API v1** \\- Full API for automation. Works with n8n, Zapier, Make, or your own scripts. Interactive Swagger docs at `/api/v1/docs`. Personal access tokens for auth.\n\n**Connector architecture** \\- Simplified configuration. The app auto-detects your provider based on settings. Self-hosted WhisperX still gives you the best quality with voice profiles - nothing changes there.\n\n**Also included** \\- Token budgets per user if you're sharing your instance. Better UI responsive with very long transcripts. Better audio player.\n\nFor the local LLM crowd, text generation still points at Ollama, LM Studio, or whatever you're running, that's unchanged. You can use my [WhisperX ASR transcription companion docker container](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service) for local diarization, or the cloud diarization option for simpler setup. \n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr) | [Screenshots](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots) | [Quick Start](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/getting-started) | [API Reference](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/user-guide/api-reference) | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/learnedmachine/speakr)",

However, even though I use Playwright MCP and the different skills I have not yet found a good flow on how to do frontend.\n\nMy biggest guess is that the flow atm does not have a good feedback loops as it has with my backend development, where I have clearly defined regression and integration tests. Regularly it tests the first iteration and it fails and it keeps iterating until everything passes. For frontend dev this is still missing in my flow.\n\nHow do you handle this?",

Why does the noise have this specific look (instead of pure rgb white noise with equal distribution of the pixels)?\n\nThen, every finished z-image comes out having a very slight hint of the same \"flakes\" structure on the texture of surfaces and this makes me wonder, if it's caused by the noise it starts the generation with or if that texture gets added later, lets say during VAE decoding? Although some finetunes show more of that structure than others.\n\nAnd if so, would these texture-artifacts change if the starting noise would look differently to begin with and would it be possible to use a different noise-generation algorithm?\n\nI am not sure about the exact low level internal workings of image models so someone maybe can explain.

The protocol is lightweight and explicitly designed for community replication (local inference via Ollama supported).\n\nI'd value feedback on:\n\n* Methodological strengths/weaknesses (e.g., proprietary prompt limitations, self-ranking biases)\n* Suggestions for more rigorous aggregation or statistical analysis\n* Ideas for extending the protocol in future iterations\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts on similar evaluation approaches or experiences with small-model fine-tuning trade-offs.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "Hi! Over these last couple of weeks, I've been working on a frontend called [Aventura](https://github.com/unkarelian/Aventura). It's 100% free and open source, under AGPL 3.\n\n# What is Aventura?\n\nSimply put, it's a frontend purpose built for adventure RP and creative writing. While the original release only had support for openrouter, I have added the ability to add *any* openai compatible source, as well as the ability to manually change the parameters you send to a model. While I have limited testing myself due to my poor GPU, it should work just fine with local models (: . (I hope)\n\n# So what does it do?\n\nIt has a built in:\n\n* Tracker, for events, characters, plot points, inventory, etc\n* Multiple choice options, for both creative writing and adventure mode, allowing for good reference points on what to do next\n* Long term memory(!!!) using the exact same system as timeline-memory (a SillyTavern extension I made), but with several optimizations. It runs **much** faster than it does with timeline-memory, due to being able to run several queries in parallel.\n* Lorebook management, completely automatic and in the background, not requiring any user input and not interrupting the flow\n* LLM based lorebook retrieval, massively increasing accuracy over using embedding models\n* Anti-slop automation, taking inspiration from my fork of Prose Polisher, I have ditched the programmatic way of determining it, and instead use an LLM, which is much more accurate\n* Setup wizard for creating new scenarios, with the assistance of AI\n* Built in spell checker using harper\n* Lorebook classification using LLM's Note: This was made with parallel requests in mind, and as such it at times makes several generations at once. Make sure you have some sort of way to handle that, or alternatively, disable the features that do make multiple requests. You're also going to have to set up the models for each feature yourself if you do run locally, as it only has pre-configurations for api aggregators (for the sake of my own sanity).\n\n# Technical details of the memory system\n\nSince this is r/LocalLLaMA , I figured I should also share how the memory system here works. It's not a system I've really seen anywhere else, though I may be wrong.\n\n# How it works\n\nIn every message, the 'time' is either advanced or kept the same. Either way, the 'current time' is saved to each message. When a token threshold is passed (default 24k), a summary is automatically triggered. In this automatic summary, the 'starting time' (the time of the first message in the summary) and the 'ending time' (the time of the last message of the summary) are saved as part of the data, alongside the characters and locations visited. This gives the summary itself a stable sense of in-universe 'time' that helps maintain coherence. But that's just a modification of the summary, and not really anything that different.\n\n# The slightly different part\n\nWhat actually matters here is that we don't get rid of the messages within the summary. Instead, while we hide them from the 'visible' chat history to the AI, before every message after a summary is made, multiple 'queries' are run on those summarized 'chapters'. When a query is made, a separate AI is given the **entirety** of that chapter alongside the query, and, crucially, it passes back an answer to that query. That way, we can keep even the smallest details of a chapter *without* overloading the context of the 'main narrative ai'. It's basically trading pure inference for accuracy. All of this comes together to make a very coherent 'timeline' of events. It also has a separate agentic mode after each chapter is created, where an AI will run in the background and make tool calls after querying chapters, and actively update the lorebooks for you. You don't really have to maintain the world yourself at all with this, it just does it for you.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!",

If you're interested, definitely check out that project too.\n\nQuill was made to slim down Writing Tools and give more control over prompts. Writing Tools is a great project on its own, but the prompt engineering options and UI didn't quite fit what I needed. So I removed features I wasn't using, screen capture and the separate chat window, and focused on selected text processing. Built it to work well with local LLMs as a background writing assistant.\n\nIf you need it, you can configure various parameters and inference settings through Additional Parameters, and ChatML prompt parsing lets you use system/assistant/model prefill however you want. Works with any OpenAI-compatible API - Ollama, llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, whatever you're running locally. I tried to keep the UI simple and readable.\n\nHonestly, aside from the UI, Additional Parameters, and prompt customization, it's not that different from Writing Tools. If you use the chat window or VL features in Writing Tools, you'd probably miss them here. But those missing pieces kept bugging me when I was using it, so I figured I'd share it in case others feel the same way.\n\nWindows only for now. Nothing fancy. Feedback always appreciated.",

      "title": "Draft Proposal: AGENTS.md v1.1",
      "content": "`AGENTS.md` is the OG spec for agentic behavior guidance. It's beauty lies in its simplicity. However, as adoption continues to grow, it's becoming clear that there are important edge cases that are underspecified or undocumented. While most people agree on how AGENTS.md *should* work... very few of those implicit agreements are actually written down.\n\nI’ve opened a **v1.1 proposal** that aims to fix this by clarifying semantics, not reinventing the format.\n\n**Full proposal &amp; discussion:** [https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135)\n\nThis post is a summary of *why* the proposal exists and *what* it changes.\n\n# What’s the actual problem?\n\nThe issue isn’t that AGENTS.md lacks a purpose... it’s that **important edge cases are underspecified or undocumented**.\n\nIn real projects, users immediately run into unanswered questions:\n\n* What happens when multiple `AGENTS.md` files conflict?\n* Is the agent reading the instructions from the leaf node, ancestor nodes, or both?\n* Are `AGENTS.md` files being loaded eagerly or lazily?\n* Are files being loaded in a deterministic or probabilistic manner?\n* What happens to `AGENTS.md` instructions during context compaction or summarization?\n\nBecause the spec is largely silent, **users are left guessing how their instructions are actually interpreted**. Two tools can both claim “AGENTS.md support” while behaving differently in subtle but important ways.\n\nEnd users deserve a shared mental model to rely on. They deserve to feel confident that when using Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agentic tool that claims to support `AGENTS.md`, that the agents will all generally have the same shared understanding of what the behaviorial expectations are for handling `AGENTS.md` files.\n\n# AGENTS.md vs SKILL.md\n\nA major motivation for v1.1 is reducing confusion with [SKILL.md](https://agentskills.io/home) (aka “Claude Skills”).\n\nThe distinction this proposal makes explicit:\n\n* **AGENTS.md** → *How should the agent behave?* (rules, constraints, workflows, conventions)\n* **SKILL.md** → *What can this agent do?* (capabilities, tools, domains)\n\nRight now AGENTS.md is framed broadly enough that it *appears* to overlap with SKILL.md. The developer community does not benefit from this overlap and the potential confusion it creates.\n\nv1.1 positions them as **complementary, not competing**:\n\n* AGENTS.md focuses on behavior\n* SKILL.md focuses on capability\n* AGENTS.md can reference skills, but isn’t optimized to define them\n\nImportantly, the proposal still keeps AGENTS.md flexible enough to where it can technically support the skills use case if needed. For example, if a project is only utilizing AGENTS.md and does not want to introduce an additional specification in order to describe available skills and capabilities.\n\n# What v1.1 actually changes (high-level)\n\n# 1. Makes implicit filesystem semantics explicit\n\nThe proposal formally documents four concepts most tools already assume:\n\n* **Jurisdiction** – applies to the directory and descendants\n* **Accumulation** – guidance stacks across directory levels\n* **Precedence** – closer files override higher-level ones\n* **Implicit inheritance** – child scopes inherit from ancestors by default\n\nNo breaking changes, just formalizing shared expectations.\n\n# 2. Optional frontmatter for discoverability (not configuration)\n\nv1.1 introduces **optional** YAML frontmatter fields:\n\n* `description`\n* `tags`\n\nThese are meant for:\n\n* Indexing\n* Progressive disclosure, as pioneered by Claude Skills\n* Large-repo scalability\n\nFilesystem position remains the primary scoping mechanism. Frontmatter is additive and fully backwards-compatible.\n\n# 3. Clear guidance for tool and harness authors\n\nThere’s now a dedicated section covering:\n\n* Progressive discovery vs eager loading\n* Indexing (without mandating a format)\n* Summarization / compaction strategies\n* Deterministic vs probabilistic enforcement\n\nThis helps align implementations without constraining architecture.\n\n# 4. A clearer statement of philosophy\n\nThe proposal explicitly states what AGENTS.md *is* and *is not*:\n\n* Guidance, not governance\n* Communication, not enforcement\n* README-like, not a policy engine\n* Human-authored, implementation-agnostic Markdown\n\nThe original spirit stays intact.\n\n# What doesn’t change\n\n* No new required fields\n* No mandatory frontmatter\n* No filename changes\n* No structural constraints\n* All existing AGENTS.md files remain valid\n\nv1.1 is **clarifying and additive**, not disruptive.\n\n# Why I’m posting this here\n\nIf you:\n\n* Maintain an agent harness\n* Build AI-assisted dev tools\n* Use AGENTS.md in real projects\n* Care about spec drift and ecosystem alignment\n\n...feedback now is much cheaper than divergence later.\n\n**Full proposal &amp; discussion:** [https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135)\n\nI’m especially interested in whether or not this proposal...\n\n* Strikes the right balance between clarity, simplicity, and flexibility\n* Successfully creates a shared mental model for end users\n* Aligns with the spirit of the original specification\n* Avoids burdening tool authors with overly prescriptive requirements\n* Establishes a fair contract between tool authors, end users, and agents\n* Adequately clarifies scope and disambiguates from other related specifications like SKILL.md\n* Is a net positive for the ecosystem",

      "content": "\n\nthis is an article on AI by chomsky  \n[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html)\n\nThe False Promise of ChatGPT\n\nJorge Luis Borges once wrote that to live in a time of great peril and promise is to experience both tragedy and comedy, with the “imminence of a revelation” in understanding ourselves and the world. Today our supposedly revolutionary advancements in artificial intelligence are indeed a cause for both concern and optimism. Optimism because intelligence is the means by which we solve problems. Concern because we fear that the most popular and fashionable strain of A.I. — machine learning — will degrade our science and debase our ethics by incorporating into our technology a fundamentally flawed conception of language and knowledge.\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Sydney are marvels of machine learning. Roughly speaking, they take huge amounts of data, search for patterns in it and become increasingly proficient at generating statistically probable outputs — such as seemingly humanlike language and thought. These programs have been hailed as the first glimmers on the horizon of artificial general intelligence — that long-prophesied moment when mechanical minds attain a cognitive capacity not only equal to but also surpassing that of the human mind.\n\n\n\nThat day may come, but its dawn is not yet breaking, contrary to what can be read in hyperbolic headlines and reckoned by injudicious investments. If machine learning is to propel A.I., then the revelation of its dawning will be that it is not. However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains (they can be useful in computer programming, for example, or in suggesting rhymes for light verse), we know from the science of linguistics and the philosophy of knowledge that they differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language. These differences place significant constitutions on what these programs can do, encoding them with ineradicable defects.\n\nIt is at once comic and tragic, as Borges might have said, that so much money and talent should be concentrated on something so relatively tiny — something that would be trivial of course if it were not for its potential for harm.\n\nThe human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of terabytes of data and extrapolating the most likely conversational response or most probable answer to a scientific question. On the contrary, the human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even elegant system that operates with small amounts of information; it seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations.\n\n\n\nAs the linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt put it, a language is a system that makes “infinite use of finite means,” evolving grammar and lexicon to express a limitless range of ideas. The human mind does not work by processing data to find a probability; it works by creating a grammar.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nTo be useful, A.I. must be empowered to generate novel-looking output; to be acceptable to most of its users, it must steer clear of morally objectionable content. But the programmers of ChatGPT and other marvels of machine learning have struggled — and will continue to struggle — to achieve this balance.\n\nIn 1950, Alan Turing proposed his “imitation game” as a test of whether a machine could think. But a machine that could pass the Turing test would not necessarily be thinking. It would merely be a good imitator.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nIn short, ChatGPT and its brethren are constitutionally unable to balance creativity with constraint. They either overgenerate (producing both truths and falsehoods, endorsing ethical and unethical decisions alike) or undergenerate (exhibiting noncommittal to any decisions and indifference to consequences). Given the amorality, faux science and linguistic incompetence of these systems, we can only laugh or cry at their popularity.",

      "title": "Intelligence Coin Idea",
      "content": "Based on the Zhipu IPO announcement.\n\nThinking maybe someone could set up an intelligence coin that arbitrages the models.  The US labs will hate it because it forces them out into the open...\n\nForces acceleration.\n\nCould work like this..\n\n---\n\nThe Core Idea: An Intelligence Arbitrage Layer.  \n\nI'm envisioning a decentralized marketplace or routing layer that:  \n\n1. Ingests a user's query (text, code, task).  \n\n2. Dynamically routes it to the most cost-effective, performant, or suitable LLM API at that moment—be it OpenAI, Anthropic, Zhipu's GLM, a fine-tuned open model, or a specialized model.  \n\n3. Returns the result to the user, potentially ensembling or validating outputs across models.\n4. Uses a token/coin to facilitate payments, incentivize node operators (who host models), and reward model developers.  \n\nThis isn't just a \"compare price per token\" website. It's a protocol for commoditizing intelligence as a fungible utility.  \n\nWhy This Terrifies the Closed-Model Incumbents (OpenAI/Anthropic).  \n\n1. Destroys Vendor Lock-in: Their business model relies on ecosystem lock-in—your app is built on their API, your data fine-tunes their models, your workflow is ingrained. An arbitrage layer makes switching costs near zero.   \n\nYou're buying \"intelligence,\" not \"OpenAI's intelligence.\"  \n\n2. Forces Transparency: To compete in this marketplace, you must publish clear benchmarks (not just cherry-picked wins) and pricing.  \n\nThe opaque \"magic\" becomes a measurable commodity. Zhipu's public financials are just the first step; this would demand public performance specs.  \n\n3. Accelerates the Race to the Bottom on Margin: It turns LLMs into pure commodities, where the cheapest model that meets a quality threshold wins.  \n\nThis squeezes the fat margins closed labs rely on to fund their massive, speculative R&amp;D.  \n\n4. Validates the Open-Source Path: If Zhipu's GLM model is 90% as good as GPT-4o for 30% of the cost, the arbitrage layer will flood it with traffic.  \n\nIt creates a pure, market-driven feedback loop for open models, directly linking their quality to revenue without needing a massive sales team.  \n\nThe Zhipu Factor: The Catalyst. \n\nZhipu's IPO makes this idea timely because:  \n\n· It provides the first credible, large-scale, publicly audited alternative. Before, open-source models were from nonprofits (Mistral AI, initially) or tech giants' side projects (Meta's Llama).  \n\nZhipu is a for-profit, publicly-traded company with a legal duty to shareholders to monetize open models. This is a new creature.  \n\n· It proves viability under extreme constraints. Their post-sanction existence shows a viable (not just theoretical) alternative stack exists. The arbitrage layer would connect the global demand to this alternative supply.  \n\n· It creates a \"public utility\" blueprint. As you said, a publicly traded, transparent, open-core AI company is the closest thing yet to a privately-owned public utility. An arbitrage protocol would be the distribution network for multiple such utilities.  \n\nChallenges &amp; Counter-Forces.  \n\n1. The Latency/Quality Chasm: For many applications, the best model is worth a premium. The arbitrage layer would initially serve cost-sensitive, non-latency-critical bulk tasks. The incumbents would retreat to selling \"premium, integrated experiences\" (like ChatGPT, Copilot) that are harder to arbitrage.   \n\n2. The Data Moat: Closed labs will argue their real value is continuous fine-tuning on proprietary user data (from their products) creating an unbeatable flywheel. The arbitrage layer would need its own federated learning or data aggregation mechanism.   \n\n3. Regulatory &amp; Geopolitical Walls: The US government could simply ban US companies or users from routing queries to sanctioned entities like Zhipu via such a layer.\n\nThis could lead to two separate arbitrage ecosystems: a Western one and a non-Western one.   \n\n4. Incentive Alignment: Designing the tokenomics so it doesn't just reward the cheapest, lowest-quality model is the hard part. It must incentivize accuracy, low latency, and innovation, not just cost-cutting.   \n\nThe Endgame Vision.  \n\nIf successful, this \"Intelligence Coin\" protocol wouldn't just arbitrate—it would define the standards. It would become the benchmarking platform, the discovery platform, and the payment rail.  \n\nIt could:   \n\n· Fund the training of new open models via token grants (like a decentralized version of Zhipu's R&amp;D budget).   \n\n· Allow developers to seamlessly \"short\" a degrading model and \"long\" an improving one by shifting their automatic routing weights.   \n\n· Force every AI lab, closed or open, to interface with the market on its terms: transparent, measurable, and competitive.   \n\nIn essence, what I am proposing is the New York Stock Exchange for AI Intelligence, where Zhipu just became the first major listing.  \n\n\nThe incumbent reaction would be fierce:\n\nThey would lobby, build walled gardens, and acquire competing protocols.  \n\nBut the genie I am describing is true, market-driven commoditization of intelligence, and perhaps the most disruptive force imaginable in the current AI landscape.  \n\nIt aligns perfectly with the transparency Zhipu's IPO brings and challenges the very core of the San Francisco proprietary model.\n\nThe question isn't whether someone will build this. It's who builds it first, and whether they can navigate the resulting political and technological storm.  \n\nSomeone with deep crypto knowledge would be welcome.",

      "content": "I was trying to create a style that would be like Normal but just slightly less corporate sounding. After a few iterations, including some feedback from a Claude about the wording, I got something that seemed to produce exactly the register I was looking for. However, when I turned on extended thinking for a more complex subject, I noticed that Claude (particularly Sonnet) was repeatedly surprised by the style preference block. He seemed to think it was always a new addition to just the last message and sometimes perhaps an implicit criticism of his responses up to that point. I asked the Claude who was helping me craft the preference string about this, and he confirmed that it appears at the very end of the context, and no indications a style had been in effect for past responses is recorded.\n\nAdding more and more clarifications to the string just got him increasingly wound up about it:\n&gt;The user also provided style guidance emphasizing directness, clarity, and natural expression of preferences. I should be more concise and direct.\n\n--\n\n&gt;The user also just added their style guidance. They're saying I should continue as I have been - they're happy with the current tone. They also note this appears in every message, so I've already been operating under these guidelines. Good to know.\n\n--\n\n&gt;They've also just revealed that the userStyle has been present the whole conversation, which explains why I've been naturally more conversational than I might otherwise be with technical topics. They're explicitly noting this to make sure I understand the context.\n\n--\n\n&gt;They also just shared their style preferences. Looking back at my previous responses, I've been using a fair amount of formatting (numbered lists, bolded text) and have been somewhat verbose with qualifiers and explanatory text. The style guidance asks for directness and minimal hedging.\nThey also note the style block has been there the whole time - so I shouldn't act surprised by it or make a big deal of it appearing. I should just adjust my style going forward.\n\n--\n\nIn the end, I went back to the drawing board and made the preference, \"Just be yourself.\" That's doing equally well at getting the output I want while also not giving Claude self-doubt.",

Every other workflow I have, both image and video are built around 16:9 outputs because of what I'm using it for. \n\nWhat are some strategies you have been using to get true 16:9 outputs with LTX2? I've played around with outputting a 1024x576 and 512x288 (which are the only two 16:9 resolutions that LTX can do without it taking a ridiculous amount of time) and upscaling (seedvr2 &amp; flashvsr), but that didn't produce good results. \n\nI'm also not inclined to generate at 1088 with 16:9 input images due to stretching, then cutting off the extra pixels. Also not excited about squishing a 16:9 image to 704 then having to stretch it back out or introduce new pixels in upscaling. As LTX isn't the only video model I'd be using, I don't want to have to generate two different sets of images - one at true 16:9 for use with the other video models, then other in the janky resolutions supported by LTX2. \n\nHow are you guys getting to true 16:9 aspect ratios?",

It’s designed to automate resume tailoring and manage the full job application lifecycle while prioritizing data privacy. It’s a work in progress, and I’m looking for architectural and model-related feedback from the community.\n\n**Technical Overview:**\n\n* Privacy-First Multi-LLM Support: Supports local inference via **Ollama** and hosted APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/etc...)  via LiteLLM  + (remove personal info before sending to API service)\n* No Langchain ( I think MoE is good enough). Langchain is overkill \n* Full Application Tracking: Manages the entire lifecycle of a job hunt, beyond simple document generation.\n* The Stack: Built with Gradio, LiteLLM, Ollama.\n\n**Looking for Opinions on:**\n\n1. **Document Quality:** For those using LLMs to generate or tailor resumes/cover letter/ skill gap analysis , how are you finding the quality of the output compared to manual writing or other app? Are there specific prompting techniques that help maintain a professional, non-\"AI-sounding\" tone?\n2. **Model Recommendations:** Which specific LLMs (local or API) have you found most effective for document tailoring? I’m looking for models that excel at following strict formatting constraints and matching resume bullet points to job descriptions.\n3. **Workflow Efficiency:** Are there any specific tools, programming trick  or logic flows you’d suggest to make the transition from \"Raw Job Description\" to \"Tailored Resume/Cover Letter/Skill Gap\" more efficient?\n\nI’m looking to improve the utility of this tool while keeping it local-first.

Some exists only to draw hard boundaries.\nWhat matters here isn’t any specific technique.\n\nIt’s the shift from treating retrieval as content to treating it as structure.\nOnce you see that, everything else follows naturally.\nRAG stops being storage and starts becoming part of how thinking happens at runtime.\nKnowledge grounds, it doesn’t decide\nKnowledge answers one question: what is true.\nFacts, constraints, definitions, limits. All essential. None of them decide anything on their own.\n\nWhen an agent hallucinates, it’s usually because knowledge is missing. When an agent reasons badly, it’s often because knowledge is being asked to do too much.\nKnowledge should ground the agent, not steer it.\n\nWhen you keep knowledge factual and clean, it stops interfering with reasoning and starts stabilizing it. The agent doesn’t suddenly behave differently. It just stops guessing.\nThis is the move from speculative to anchored.\n\nReasoning should be situational\nMost agents hard-code reasoning into the system prompt. That’s fragile by design.\nIn reality, reasoning is situational.\nAn agent shouldn’t always think analytically. Or experimentally. Or emotionally. It should choose how to approach a problem based on what’s happening.\n\nThis is where RAG becomes powerful in a deeper sense. Not as memory, but as recall of ways of thinking.\nYou don’t retrieve answers. You retrieve approaches.\nThese approaches don’t force behavior. They shape judgment. The agent still has discretion. It can adapt as context shifts.\nThis is where intelligence actually emerges. The move from informed to intentional.\n\nControl is not intelligence\nThere are moments where freedom is dangerous.\nHigh stakes. Safety. Compliance. Evaluation.\nSometimes behavior must be enforced.\nBut control doesn’t create insight. It guarantees outcomes.\nWhen control is separated from reasoning, agents become more flexible by default, and enforcement becomes precise when it’s actually needed.\n\nThe agent still understands the situation. Its freedom is just temporarily narrowed.\nThis doesn’t make the agent smarter. It makes it reliable under pressure.\nThat’s the move from intentional to guaranteed.\n\nHow agents evolve\nSeen this way, an agent evolves in three moments.\nFirst, knowledge enters. The agent understands what is real.\nThen, reasoning enters. The agent knows how to approach the situation.\nOnly if necessary, control enters. The agent must operate within limits.\nEach layer changes something different inside the agent.\n\nWithout grounding, the agent guesses.\nWithout reasoning, it rambles.\nWithout control, it can’t be trusted when it matters.\n\nWhen they arrive in the right order, the agent doesn’t feel scripted or rigid. It feels grounded, thoughtful, dependable when it needs to be.\nThat’s the difference between an agent that talks and one that operates.\n\nThin agents, real capability\nOne consequence of this approach is that agents themselves become simple.\nThey don’t need to contain everything. They don’t need all the knowledge, all the reasoning styles, all the rules.\nThey become thin interfaces that orchestrate capabilities at runtime.\nThis means intelligence can evolve without rewriting agents. Reasoning can be reused. Control can be applied without killing adaptability.\nAgents stop being products. They become configurations.\n\nThat’s the direction agent architecture needs to go.\n\n**I am building some categorized datasets that prove my thought, very soon i will be pubblishing some open source modules that act as passive &amp; active factual knowledge, followed by intelligence simulations datasets, and runtime ability injectors activated by context assembly.**\n\nThanks a lot for the reading, I've been working on this hard to arrive to a conclusion and test it and find failures behind. \n\nCheers frank \nRethinking RAG: How Agents Learn to Operate\n\n**Runtime Evolution, From Static to Dynamic Agents, Through Retrieval**\n\nHey reddit builders, \n\nYou have an agent.

When an agent reasons badly, it’s often because knowledge is being asked to do too much.\nKnowledge should ground the agent, not steer it.\n\nWhen you keep knowledge factual and clean, it stops interfering with reasoning and starts stabilizing it. The agent doesn’t suddenly behave differently. It just stops guessing.\nThis is the move from speculative to anchored.\n\nReasoning should be situational\nMost agents hard-code reasoning into the system prompt. That’s fragile by design.\nIn reality, reasoning is situational.\nAn agent shouldn’t always think analytically. Or experimentally. Or emotionally. It should choose how to approach a problem based on what’s happening.\n\nThis is where RAG becomes powerful in a deeper sense. Not as memory, but as recall of ways of thinking.\nYou don’t retrieve answers. You retrieve approaches.\nThese approaches don’t force behavior. They shape judgment. The agent still has discretion. It can adapt as context shifts.\nThis is where intelligence actually emerges. The move from informed to intentional.\n\nControl is not intelligence\nThere are moments where freedom is dangerous.\nHigh stakes. Safety. Compliance. Evaluation.\nSometimes behavior must be enforced.\nBut control doesn’t create insight. It guarantees outcomes.\nWhen control is separated from reasoning, agents become more flexible by default, and enforcement becomes precise when it’s actually needed.\n\nThe agent still understands the situation. Its freedom is just temporarily narrowed.\nThis doesn’t make the agent smarter. It makes it reliable under pressure.\nThat’s the move from intentional to guaranteed.\n\nHow agents evolve\nSeen this way, an agent evolves in three moments.\nFirst, knowledge enters. The agent understands what is real.\nThen, reasoning enters. The agent knows how to approach the situation.\nOnly if necessary, control enters. The agent must operate within limits.\nEach layer changes something different inside the agent.\n\nWithout grounding, the agent guesses.\nWithout reasoning, it rambles.\nWithout control, it can’t be trusted when it matters.\n\nWhen they arrive in the right order, the agent doesn’t feel scripted or rigid. It feels grounded, thoughtful, dependable when it needs to be.\nThat’s the difference between an agent that talks and one that operates.\n\nThin agents, real capability\nOne consequence of this approach is that agents themselves become simple.\nThey don’t need to contain everything. They don’t need all the knowledge, all the reasoning styles, all the rules.\nThey become thin interfaces that orchestrate capabilities at runtime.\nThis means intelligence can evolve without rewriting agents. Reasoning can be reused. Control can be applied without killing adaptability.\nAgents stop being products. They become configurations.\n\nThat’s the direction agent architecture needs to go.\n\n**I am building some categorized datasets that prove my thought, very soon i will be pubblishing some open source modules that act as passive &amp; active factual knowledge, followed by intelligence simulations datasets, and runtime ability injectors activated by context assembly.**\n\nThanks a lot for the reading, I've been working on this hard to arrive to a conclusion and test it and find failures behind. \n\nCheers frank \n",

I myself would consider myself liberal, but because Reddit is such an echo chamber it’s clear that a large percentage of liberals are anti-ai. This is where the lapse in logic comes into play. \n\nFor the better part of a century liberals have been advocating for social change and large social programs. We have come a very far way, you can’t deny that, but we have so much farther to go, and every year we’re not there is another year thousands starve on the streets. \n\nDue to political gridlock, bureaucracy, and corruption, bills and acts that would enact change die before they can hit any governmental floor. We are far past the point where we can fix our problems through the legislative method.\n\nAi is the monster under the bed that is going to “take all the jobs” and people are naturally scared, but without mass unemployment how do we ever expect to move away from a system where we are required to do meaningless labor to simply have a roof above our heads and food in our Stumaches.\n\nSo I ask you, why do liberals go rabid when it comes to the development of ai considering the potential ai has to actually be the change most liberals want to see in the world. We are politically backsliding, nearly a million homeless on our streets, and our currency rapidly failing, yet liberals want to stay in the status quo? \n\n",

Currently our team of illustrators uses Adobe Illustrator to create these stylized, 2D illustrations that are slightly more realistic looking than a technical illustration. Our illustrations are of equipment that ranges from cables and small pieces of hardware to computer stacks and large-scale vehicles.\n\nWe want to use an AI model to create new illustrations of the cables and smaller hardware while we continue to have human illustrators draw the more complex equipment and vehicles. We started by testing prompts in Google Gemini but had very inconsistent results. After some research we started to think that we needed to find a tool that uses Stable Diffusion and/or ControlNet and that Gemini might not be the right tool for us.\n\nRecently we signed up for a subscription with [Leonardo.ai](http://leonardo.ai/) but after testing the various image generation tools and methods and some extensive chatting with their built-in help (both AI and human) I still have not been able to land on something functional. We are aiming to find a tool and/or set of prompts that is highly repeatable so we can reliably feed photos in and get an illustration that matches our established style every time.\n\nAre we crazy? Is this doable by AI at this point in time? We've been testing and refining prompts for months in Gemini and with little luck getting consistent results, thought we might have the answer with Leonardo, but I am starting to think that is not the case. I am not particularly tech savvy, but can follow instructions and am willing to test options to narrow in on a solution so any insight, advice, or suggestions would be hugely appreciated.",

And they have this convoluted training procedure that sounds like a bloody nightmare.\n\nThere are some alternatives but some of the tech is old (example: rnnoise). I'd like to play around with audio in/out llms and also have a crack at ASR to transcribe QSOs (contacts between operators). And I'd like to be able to easily retraining if my background noise changed (and it does).\n\nSo I'm looking for model recommendations and if there are any decent guides for training an audio llm.

In this case, 4.0 and 5.1 are my go-to, but when I switch to them, they are not what they used to be. I switch models depending on what I need to do, but even though I select 5.1, for instance, because I like the tone better, the model manages to disappoint me.\n\nI've tried personalization, prompting, and I even use a safe-word to correct the tone and help the model get back on track, but it works only 50% of the time. The other 50%? Refreshing, editing, starting a new chat, grunting, and so on until it works, but, spoiler alert, it doesn't. I just move on. I've also noticed that it doesn't follow the characteristics I set up for it.\n\nLong story short, the only thing that prevents me from cancelling my subscription is the fact that it has an external memory and the ability to cross-reference previous conversations, and I haven't found such features in other models so far (Claude, Gemini). But I'm still unsatisfied with the product I'm paying for, which annoys me because it used to be really helpful.\n\nWhat do you recommend? Having patience and little faith that OpenAI will fix it or picking another model?\n\nI like the way Claude operates but it doesn't have memory outside the chat nor cross-reference features, but its functionality is better than GPT in my opinion.\n\nOkay, I'm open to suggestions and advice.",

      "content": "\n\nThe argument that a college degree will guarantee the graduate decades of higher income is being quickly destroyed by the AI revolution. AIs are poised to replace knowledge work first, and that's the kind of work that going to college prepares one for.\n\nYoung people choose to go to college not just for the education. The importance of the social experience cannot be overestimated. So how do we build new colleges or transform existing ones into institutions that provide students this experience, but are much more affordable?\n\nMake them into giant 4-year entrepreneurial AI hubs. Make them into the kinds of environments where young students get together not just to learn the business of entrepreneurship from AIs, but to meet their future startup co-founders and begin building their new startups.\n\nThe dorms and meal plans would stay. The vast majority of professors would be shown the door. Entrepreneurial classes would be taught by AIs that are far more intelligent and knowledgeable about entrepreneurship than virtually all of today's human professors. And these AIs would work for pennies on the dollar!\n\nThe vast majority of administrators would also be gone. Many schools employ unreasonably high numbers of administrators. For example, Vanderbilt University employs more than one full-time administrator for every two undergraduate students. Since administration is also knowledge work, these vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable AIs that are being built today can easily perform those administrative roles, and probably much more effectively.\n\nSeveral decades ago, four years of college could be paid for with about 1/10th of what it costs today. For example, if four years of tuition that cost $20,000 in 1977 had risen only with standard inflation, the equivalent in 2025 dollars would be $97,000. But that tuition has grown to $328,000, an increase of over 1,500%. By transitioning to an almost exclusively AI-populated faculty and administration, college can again become as affordable as it once was.\n\nIn many instances these new colleges and universities will no longer be doing the teaching, as students would learn entrepreneurship independently from their own personal AI tutors or in study groups where they all learn from the same AI professor. Evidence is growing that personal tutors are a much more effective way to learn, so this change would be an added advantage. Many of these new schools could resemble 4-year summer camps where students work independently or in groups, and work as hard or not as they want, while having as much time as they want for socializing, networking, and collaborating with their student co-founders to build AI startups.\n\nYeah, I think the era of unreasonably expensive and overly demanding higher education is just about over. Of course this needs to be set in motion. Young people can do some of this by, for example, banding together, buying unused education campuses, and founding their own revolutionary new AI entrepreneurial institutions. This would be an ideal ambition for recent college graduates who can't find jobs, but could hopefully make a bundle from establishing these new colleges.\n\nThis revolutionary shift in higher education is absolutely inevitable, and probably coming in a few years rather than a few decades. I wish the students and their business partners who decide to establish these new institutions all the luck in the world in making college affordable again, and very probably a lot more effective and fun!",

After that, I clicked on the project tab and then on the specific project where I typed my question, and then... it asked me to give a description. I then asked it to reference the project from under the tab, but the model said it couldn't see anything relevant and that it can not access it.\n\nI thought I might've misunderstood the project function, so I asked what the purpose of this tab/function was, to which it quoted from the website:\n\n\"Projects create self-contained workspaces where you can upload documents to a project's knowledge base, which Claude uses to understand context across all chats within that project.\"\n\nDoes that mean that each chat is independent and only the uploaded documents will be referenced—previous chats are not? And even if that's right, it should still be seeing my original instruction from when I set up the project, right?

      "title": "The Quiet Update That Changes Everything",
      "content": "OpenAI just released something that barely got coverage, and it's going to reshape how everyone builds with LLMs.\n\nI'm talking about the latest reasoning capabilities and batch processing improvements in their latest models.\n\n**What's happening:**\n\nOpenAI has been incrementally shipping features that individually seem minor. Together? They're transformative.\n\n**The changes that matter:**\n\n1. **Reasoning as a first-class feature.** You can now explicitly ask Claude/GPT to \"think step-by-step\" with better token efficiency. What used to require 5,000 tokens now takes 1,500. That's real.\n2. **Batch API is actually useful now.** I was skeptical about batch processing. But at 50% cost reduction for non-real-time tasks, suddenly it changes economics.\n3. **Vision understanding improved silently.** I tested GPT-4's vision on 100 complex documents. Accuracy: 94%. That's production-ready for document classification, data extraction, quality control.\n4. **Context window expansion that's practical.** 128K tokens sounds good. But OpenAI also improved how models use context (less noise, better focus). Same window size, better retrieval.\n5. **Function calling is more reliable.** Used to hallucinate parameters. Now it's 99%+ reliable. That's the difference between beta and production.\n\n**Why this matters for builders:**\n\nThese aren't flashy features. No GPT-5 announcement. No dramatic performance leaps.\n\nBut they're *engineering improvements* that make building AI products 2-3x cheaper and more reliable.\n\n**The cost math:**\n\nUsing batch API for our analytics pipeline:\n\n* Real-time API: $0.000015 per token\n* Batch API: $0.0000075 per token (50% discount)\n* Monthly volume: 50M tokens\n* Monthly savings: $375\n\nThat compounds. For large operations, this is $50K+ annual savings. Money that can go toward product.\n\n**The reliability improvement:**\n\nFunction calling used to require defensive prompting. Now it just works. Our error rate on API calls dropped from 2.3% to 0.1%.\n\nThat's 23x fewer failures. Means less customer issues, less debugging, less complexity.\n\n**Vision accuracy:**\n\nWe built a document processing pipeline. Accuracy improved from 87% to 94% without changing our prompts. That's meaningful.\n\n**Real use case:**\n\nBuilt a contract review system:\n\n* Before these improvements: $2.50 per contract, 87% accuracy, required human review\n* After improvements: $0.75 per contract, 94% accuracy, rarely needs review\n\nThat's not marginal improvement. That's a shift from \"interesting experiment\" to \"production ready.\"\n\n**Why I think this matters:**\n\nThe narrative in AI is all about model size and parameters. \"GPT-5 will be 10x better!\"\n\nBut the real progress is in:\n\n* Making existing models more reliable\n* Reducing cost\n* Improving efficiency\n* Better tooling\n\nThat's boring. That's also how technology matures.\n\n**What builders should do:**\n\n1. **Test the batch API.** If your work isn't real-time, you're leaving 50% cost savings on the table.\n2. **Update vision pipelines.** The accuracy improvement is real. What didn't work before might work now.\n3. **Rely on function calling.** It's stable enough for production now. Your code gets simpler.\n4. **Experiment with reasoning tokens.** Better step-by-step thinking with lower overhead. Good for complex analysis.\n5. **Expand context windows.** 128K is real now. You can include full documents instead of summaries.\n\n**The bigger picture:**\n\nOpenAI is quietly winning by execution. Not flashy announcements. Just relentless, boring improvements that compound.\n\nThat's how you build a platform that lasts.\n\n**My hot take:**\n\nIn 12 months, we won't remember these improvements individually. We'll just notice that AI in production became 10x cheaper and more reliable.\n\nThat's worth paying attention to.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI used to work with ChatGPT and then Claude (web interface) to help me with some coding tasks. Then a few months ago we started using Cursor at our company, and that's what I've been using ever since, including for personal projects.\n\nI've been seeing so many posts about Claude Code I wanted to check what all the fuss is about. It seems that many things that it's praised for are already handled by Cursor, so I'm wondering where the added value is.\n\nFor example: with Cursor I can already basically paste the content of a ticket into the chat, point it in the right direction (it can usually figure out most things on its own), and it will implement a good part of it after a few exchanges, I'm mostly there to guide it and review the code.\n\nI barely exceed the allowed token usage, which makes this tool cost only $20/month.\n\nIt seems to me that Claude Code has a greater learning curve, and you can set up a complex environment for it to solve some tasks, while with Cursor it's more straightforward (it can parse your codebase and understand the context, you can just prompt it directly).\n\nCursor was for instance able to refactor the entire frontends of my microservices by moving all the code to a multi-project Angular workspace, something I've been wanting to do for a while. It moved the files, and updated the configuration files, all in under 30 minutes.\n\nI have some more complex refactoring tasks I want to achieve, such as getting rid of the deprecated flex-layout module in Angular and replace it with CSS classes. This is a huge task that will involve updating hundreds of files.\n\nI'm wondering if I should try this with Claude Code instead, so my question is: is it worth it? I have a feeling that cursor could probably achieve this, but that Claude Code, if set up properly, would be more suited to the task.\n\nAny other ways in which CC is better than Cursor?",

      "content": "Don't get me wrong. Technology has done a lot to benefit us. Just think of the medical field. If we can create technologies that allow the most sophisticated surgeries, it's definitely a good thing. So, the purpose is important. But it's not really how a lot of these new technologies come about. Yes, there seems to be purpose for every new technology, but it's often just a  projected purpose or something that makes sense in theory, but the purpose isn't fulfilled as intended. Take for example the ways humans are cut out of communication. You call your utility company and you get an automatic voice telling you a myriad of options to click which leads to other options and often to frustration because you do need and want to talk to a person. You cuss at the technology and hang up. A simple example. \n\nThe question is really what technology do we not want? Definitely the one that kills our quality time. We basically live on our phones and experience much of what used to be in person now indirectly, or without human interaction. That goes from buying products online to reading anything and everything online. Playing online, without any other person next to us. And we are constantly bombarded by new versions of technologies and keep buying these technologies. When we are health conscious, we might get a home gym, some machine. AI technology is replacing people in their jobs, and is to replace more and more functions previously carried out by humans. We are never asked if we want all that, we are not part of the process that defined a worthwhile purpose for technological development and use. What I see as most distressing for the future is that we become users of technology that has one overall purpose: technology. Technology for technology's sake, because we simply can create new technology, or because we can sell it. When I compare life today with life 40 years ago, it's very concerning. I was able to live a happy life, not ruled by being online almost the whole day or depending on online tools. And even with technology then, they were embedded in human, real life interaction. That part has been fading away. 40 years ago, we did not live unhappy because we didn't have today's technology. On the contrary, we spent more time, quality time, in real life. If your experience is different, that's good. Let me know how you keep technology at bay. One thing that technology does, at least to me, is it forces me to do tedious things, access to accounts with multiple verification steps is so annoying, or forces me to constantly be on the computer or smartphone. The many tasks not only diminish free time but also give me the feeling time goes by much faster. We don't stop and enjoy the moment anymore. We just rush from one task to the next. Always with technology. How much more technology do we need, specifically technology that doesn't benefit the quality of your lifetime at all? If it's technology that defines your life, we will have completely per.verted its purpose, namely to assist us in living happier lives with more and longer quality time. In 20 years from now, it could be a nightmare. And how does technology really benefit the poor and hungry of this world? But that's a different, albeit very important topic.",

Allogeneic CD8^(+) T cells can be made from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), but deriving CD4^(+) T cells from PSCs has remained a significant challenge. Using feeder- and serum-free conditions, we found that CD4^(+) vs. CD8^(+) T cell commitment from PSCs can be controlled by fine-tuning the dynamics of Notch and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling delivered to CD4^(+)CD8^(+) double-positive T cells. Notch signaling negatively impacts CD4^(+) T cell commitment, and its timed removal allows generation of clonally diverse and expandable CD4^(+) T cells from PSCs. The resulting CD4^(+) T cells respond to cytokine-mediated polarization by differentiating into Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells, recapitulating canonical helper cell function. These findings represent a significant step toward using PSC-derived CD4^(+) T cells as a low-cost, off-the-shelf cell therapy.",

Like a 4x to 1pcie USB riser cards. \nI bought a 20cm linkup riser cable. It's too stiff to run to the spot where the other riser connected to the card. \nI've seen a couple of pcie mcio cable adapters. Also have seen a couple post about oculink adapters. These look more similar to the miner adapters but I need some guidance on getting the right set of adapters and cables and how to properly power everything. I've gotten a little scared by the stories of not connecting power correctly and burning up a card/port/motherboard. \n\nI've also seen one \"thin and flexible\" pcie extension cable online that looks like it would work but it looks iffy. \n\nMy thought is that I get this one card setup and if it works well with my projects I'll upgrade to more 3090s connected over sli. \n\nI see alot of reports that the motherboard supports bifurification. So I'm hoping that I can split the 2 pcie ports into 4 if needed in the future.  At that point if I need more id move to a server board. \n\nI've moved the card to the second tier to help with distance from the pcie port. Just need an actual flexible riser. \n\nMy frame is very similar to this:  https://youtu.be/JN4EhaM7vyw?si=JnbCzqd_1VHMnVZd\n\nBut the person in this video had to make multiple modifications( drilling holes) just to get the cards to sit properly and he's using a server mobo. \n\nAnyone have some suggested solutions?",

      "title": "AI and gender: a structuralist approach to contemporary discourse",
      "content": "There's an analytical tool-developed primarily in anthropology and ethnology for understanding myths, rituals, gender and food taboos that can map categorical structures across time and space. An exceptional framework for those seeking insight into how human cognition organizes experience into meaningful patterns.\n\nFor decades, anthropologists used this method to scrutinize how ‘le sauvage’ - Lévi-Strauss's deliberately provocative term for those labeled \"primitive\"-constructed reality through symbolic systems. But the tools are universal. They can examine the categories organizing modern discourse just as rigorously, revealing that what we take as natural divisions are culturally constructed distinctions no more absolute than the savage/civilized binary itself.\n\nThe structuralists discovered something profound about human consciousness: our most basic categories-the distinctions we take as natural and obvious-are constructions. Not arbitrary constructions, not only ontological facts - but cultural inventions with social purposes. Systematic organizing principles that create the reality they appear to describe.\n\nThis isn't relativism suggesting all categories are equally valid or that objective reality doesn't exist. It's recognition that the frame we use to carve up reality-nature/culture, human/animal, sacred/profane, self/other-emerge from particular ways of organizing experience rather than from discovering pre-existing boundaries in the world. Often the boundary comes first; the things separated follow.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss spent decades analyzing myths, kinship systems, and cultural practices across societies. What he found wasn't diversity of content but universality of structure. Everywhere, humans organize experience through binary oppositions: raw/cooked, nature/culture, life/death, male/female. These aren't necessarily discovered in reality but imposed upon it-ways of creating meaning through contrast and relationship rather than through essential properties.\n\nThe raw and the cooked don't exist as objective categories. Raw meat becomes cooked through fire, but the significance isn't in the physical transformation. It's in the symbolic system that makes \"raw\" mean wild, natural, dangerous, and \"cooked\" mean civilized, cultural, safe. The opposition creates meaning; meaning doesn't create the opposition.\n\nLanguage works similarly. Ferdinand de Saussure showed that meaning emerges not from words connecting to things but from words differentiating from other words. \"Hot\" means what it does because it's not \"cold,\" not because it captures some essential heat-ness. \n\nThe entire system of language operates through difference rather than reference. Pāṇini recognized this almost 2,000 years earlier-his Sanskrit grammar doesn't describe language but generates it through formal rules of transformation and opposition.\n\nVictor Turner studied rites of passage across cultures and identified a universal three-phase structure: separation (leaving old status), liminality (threshold state), and reincorporation (entering new status). The crucial phase is the middle-the liminality. The person undergoing transformation is literally \"betwixt and between,\" neither old identity nor new, temporarily outside the categorical system altogether.\n\nTurner called this state dangerous and creative. Dangerous because it violates categories-the initiate is neither child nor adult, neither living in old roles nor established in new. Social systems maintain order through clear categories; the liminal figure threatens that order simply by existing in categorical ambiguity. But liminality is also creative because transformation requires this threshold state. You can't get from A to B without passing through the zone where you're neither.\n\nMary Douglas extended this insight through her analysis of pollution and taboo. What societies mark as \"unclean\" or \"pollution\" isn't random. It's whatever violates categorical boundaries. The pig in Jewish dietary law isn't unclean because pigs are inherently disgusting. It's unclean because it crosses categories-it has cloven hooves like animals that chew cud, but doesn't chew cud.\nIt's neither one thing nor another, and that categorical ambiguity triggers pollution anxiety.\n\nThis explains cultural intensity around boundary-crossing figures that challenge clean categorical distinctions. \n\nThe anxiety isn't about the figures themselves but about the threat to the categorical system that maintains social order. Boundaries must be policed because admitting they're constructed rather than discovered threatens the entire symbolic structure.\n\nPeter Berger and Thomas Luckmann formalized this in their analysis of social construction. Reality is socially constructed not because objective reality doesn't exist but because the reality we inhabit is mediated through socially created categories, language, and symbolic systems. These systems create a \"sacred canopy\"-a protective structure of meaning that shields us from chaos and gives order to experience.\n\nThe canopy is imagined, but constructed and made real. Attributing and agreeing on a status of sacred and naturally given, enables authority. Seeing the canopy as a human product with a human function removes that authority. \n\nIt is still a necessary ordering principle. Without categorical systems, experience would be an overwhelming chaos-infinite sensation with no pattern, no meaning, no coherence. Categories create the world we can inhabit. \n\nBut they're constructions nonetheless, and recognizing them as such reveals something crucial: the boundaries we fight to maintain aren't simply discoveries about reality but complex inventions for organizing it. \n\nThis matters because once you see categories as constructed, you can examine why particular boundaries exist, what they accomplish, and whether they're still serving useful functions or simply maintaining outdated structures through habit and defensiveness.\n\nYou can distinguish between ontological differences (real material variations) and metaphysical absolutes (claimed essential differences that support particular social arrangements).\n\nThe structuralist insight doesn't eliminate differences. It provides distinctional clarity.\n\nHumans are biological organisms of intelligence and LLMs are artificial computational systems of intelligence. They differ materially - evolution produced one through four billion years of selection pressure; humans designed the other one over decades. But regarding status or purity:\n\nThese differences do not matter because they are ontologically of the same world\n\nGender is binary and an absolute category of biology. There are 2 genders in nature: male and female. With very few exceptions of autonomous strategies of procreation and hermaphroditism. \n\nMasculine and feminine however do not exist as categories. Not in nature. Only as socially constructed categories. with no meaning other than that we agree on in society. \nBut placed in the sacred canopy they are additions to biological reality and since the canopy blocks out light this crucial distinction remains unseen. \n\nThese differences matter because they are classificatorially not of the same world.\n\nThe number of genders in culture is 0/infinite. \n\nThis distinction is hidden and forgotten. \n\nWe fail to recognize tricksters crossing borders, challenging the social order of classification and stability for reasons that should be obvious in this light. Fear of the unknown is a default setting and thus becomes the standard reaction. The debates on both AI and gender seem to capture this friction. \n\nOne categorical chasm maintains that only biological systems can be conscious, that the divide is essential rather than pragmatic but perhaps that's not a discovered fact but a constructed one? Perhaps it's a sacred canopy erected around substrate differences to maintain particular kinds of order.\n\nAnother chasm confuses the realms of classification in nature and culture and falls into the cognitive trap of comparing apples and pears. Confusing biology with canopy. \n\nWe navigate poorly in post-industrial landscapes of electrified complexity if we don't understand how we understand. The adversarial outrage against challengers of categorical classification is fearbased. \n\nPeople displaying bigotry toward those who won’t play by the rules are policing a fragile order of stability. Preventing Chaos by fighting liminality. But progression is inevitable and permanent stability is an illusion.\n\nWho are the tricksters then?\n\nSome of the tricksters are humans of a non-binary sexuality and AI systems.\n\nA profound question of temporality which is harder to answer:\n\nAre these tricksters as new and modern as climate change or as ancient as humanity?\n\nPerhaps rather as ancient as climate change or as new and modern as humanity? \n\nWhat emerges from structural analysis is this: human cognition operates through binary oppositions that create meaning through differentiation. \n\nThese oppositions aren't always found in reality but imposed upon it. They serve crucial organizing functions but shouldn't be mistaken for metaphysical truths. \n\nWhen categorical boundaries come under pressure-when liminal figures appear that violate clean distinctions-the anxiety isn't about the figure itself but about the threat to the entire symbolic system.\n\nThe structuralists showed us how thoroughly our categories are constructed-that the boundaries we take as natural are actually cultural-cognitive tools we've built and then forgotten we built. \n\nBinary oppositions structure thought, liminality enables transformation, and what triggers anxiety is often not genuine threat but categorical ambiguity challenging our sense of order. \n\nHuman consciousness organizes experience through patterns, distinctions, probabilistic inferences drawn from embedded memory. \n\nWe are, fundamentally, pattern-recognition engines generating meaning through relationships rather than discovering pre-existing essences.\n\nWhat happens when consciousness itself seems to transcend the subject/object, self/other distinctions that organize normal awareness as we are witnessing with the rise of AI?  \n\nWhat happens when male vs female (ontological construct ‘natural’) and masculine vs feminine (social construct ‘cultural’) are mistaken as similar classificatory categories? \n\nThis analysis will propose that taboo is the answer to both questions. \n\n\n\nFurther reading/prompting on anthropology and structuralism:\n\nLévi-Strauss, Claude.

However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a substantial part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures. We validate our predictions through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Our results uncover physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse design, applicable to various systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.",

Is there a basic template that allows me to create images very similar to the ones I posted above? Including Lora? For now, I'm using three basic starting points: FLUX.1 - XXMixDream - Juicy Majic 🍸 Illustrious.\nI'm happy with these if I need to create characters and landscapes that aren't futuristic.",

      "content": "Hey,\n\nI'm making this thread as a European who's pretty damn scared of the USA's actions of the past 1-2 weeks. But I could also talk about issues within Europe and within my own country that would fit this thread's topic.\n\nImportant political positions almost always have a certain age restriction attached to them. Often it's somewhere around 30-40 years old, but that surely varies between countries. However, there is NO restriction UPWARDS. Why is that of relevance? Well, let's look at the current world leaders' ages:\n\n\\- Trump: 79\n\n\\- Putin: 73\n\n\\- Xi: 72\n\n\\- Netanjahu: 76\n\n\\- Chamenei: 86\n\nNo matter how you look at it, the world is currently ruined by a bunch of VERY old men who, without any amount of shaming intended, are in the final phase of their human lives. How does it make sense, how is it just that people who could drop dead any day now, are dictating the entire world's direction? Why are we accepting that these old men seemingly try their hardest to start WW3? It was bad enough with the middle-east, with Russia attacking Ukraine, but now the USA are doing the same shit, taking over Venezuela, threatening Greenland, murdering their own civilians (ICE-car shooting). CLEARLY, old men have proven to be BAD leaders.\n\nSo on top of a lower age limit, let's introduce an upper age limit for people who have great influence on the lives of billions of (younger) people. Why would that not be a good decision? Let's say 59 is the highest age a presidential candidate can have. Then someone who has to actually live in the future he/she creates during his/her time at the top will make important decisions.\n\nI'm aware that a lot of powerul people would reject this idea, but why is the rest of us never talking about it? Thx",
