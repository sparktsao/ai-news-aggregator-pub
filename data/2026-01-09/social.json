      "content": "Survival of the fittest code.\n\nCore War (1984) is a game where programs must crash their opponents to survive. Warriors written in an assembly language called Redcode fight for control of a virtual machine.\n\nOur new paper: Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs, explores what happens when LLMs drive an adversarial evolutionary arms race in this domain.\n\nWe task LLMs to write Warrior programs in Redcode that must out-compete a virtual world full of such programs. Core War is a Turing-complete environment where code and data share the same address space, which leads to some very chaotic self-modifying code dynamics.\n\nThis approach is inspired by the Red Queen hypothesis in evolutionary biology: the principle that species must continually adapt and evolve simply to survive against ever changing competitors. In our work, programs continuously adapt to defeat a growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark.\n\nWe find that this adversarial process leads to the emergence of increasingly general strategies, including targeted self-replication, data bombing, and massive multithreading. Most intriguingly, it reveals a form of convergent evolution. Different code implementations settle into similar high performing behaviors, mirroring how biological agents independently evolve similar traits to solve the same problems.\n\nI think this work positions Core War as a sandbox for studying Red Queen dynamics in artificial systems. It offers a safe controlled environment for analyzing how AI agents might evolve in real world adversarial settings such as cybersecurity.\n\nBy simulating these adversarial dynamics in an isolated sandbox, we offer a glimpse into the future where deployed LLM systems may start competing against one another for limited resources in the real world.",

I’m going to try to at least skim one of the papers in my bookmarks each weekday for the rest of the month.\n\n#PaperADay\n\n2025: Emergent temporal abstractions in autoregressive models enable hierarchical reinforcement learning (Google)\n\nI like their statement of the hierarchical goal problem  as “how long does it take a twitching hand to win a game of chess?”  @RichardSSutton is fond of the “options” framework in RL, but we don’t have a clear method to learn them from scratch.\n\nTheir Ant environment is designed to require two levels of planning: the standard mujoco Ant locomotion work to be able to move at all, and routing decisions to get to the colored squares in the correct order, which will happen hundreds of frames apart.\n\nBasically, this takes a pre-trained sequence predicting model that predicts what separately trained expert models (manually steered) do, and inserts a metacontroller midway through it, which can tweak the residual values to perform high level “steering”, and can be RL’d at high level switch points to much greater performance than the base pre-trained model.\n\nA key claim here is that learning to predict actions in a supervised next-token manner from lots of existing expert examples, even if you don’t know the goals, results in inferring useful higher level goals. This sounds plausible, but their experiment makes it rather easy for the model: the expert RL models that generated the training data were explicitly given one of four goals in each segment, and the option learning model just classifies the sequences into one of four categories. This is a vastly simpler problem than free form option discovery.\n\nA State Space Model is used for the more complex Ant environments, while a transformer is used for the simpler grid world environments. I didn’t see an explanation for the change.\n\nThe internal “walls” are more like “poison tiles”, since they don’t block movement like the map edges, they just kill the ant when its center passes into them.\n\nThe 3D renderings (with shadow errors that hurt my gamedev eyes) are somewhat misleading, since it is really a 2D world that the agent gets to fully observe in a low dimensional one-hot format. It doesn’t do any kind of partially observed or pixel based sensing.\n\nEverything is done with massively parallel environments, avoiding the harder online learning challenges.\n\nThe success rates still aren’t great after a million episodes.\n\nI would like to see this applied to Atari, basically doing GATO with less capable experts or lower episode quantities, then trying to identify free form options that can be usefully used to RL to higher performance.",

      "content": "@trevin Thank you. Factory is, in my opinion—and I'm slightly biased, but given the benchmarks—the best performing harness for an agent. It handles things that I don't need to think about, where I might need to think about them more if I'm using Claude Code or Codex or other tools. It can just get the job done better than I can get it done with other agents.\n\nThat's one thing. Another thing is that I don't need to think about: if I'm on Claude Code I can only use Claude models; if I'm on Codex I can only use OpenAI—switch between them if I choose to—and if I want to use Gemini, I can use that as well, all in the same flow, all in the same session, all in the same projects, without really thinking about the different tools. It's just like the one tool that rules it all for me.\n\nAnd then the VPS setup is I basically just set up a droplet on DigitalOcean and installed Droid there, and then I use something called Syncthing to sync certain repos from my machine, my local machine, to the VPS. And then two days ago I actually bought a Mac Mini, and then I've connected them all with Tailscale. So I actually have, then, when I'm offline—like off my computer—then I can use Slack to talk to Droid in a local or remote state. \n\nThat's generally how I do it.

      "content": "Nobody is going to post about automating boring tasks. But that's where the money is!\n\nI know everyone is obsessed with building flashy demos because they look impressive, but they don't pay the bills.\n\nThink about all the repetitive tasks a team does every day:\n\n1. Running smoke tests after every deployment\n2. Filling out forms across multiple systems\n3. Checking that your checkout flow still works\n4. Verifying login flows across browsers\n\nAll of these tasks eat up hours of developer time every single week. If you can cut down the time they take, you'll be saving companies a ton of money.\n\nIf you are doing something twice, you can probably automate it.\n\nYou can use the Amazon Nova Act playground to generate scripts to automate all of these tasks:\n\n1. Go to the Amazon Nova Act playground\n2. Describe what you want in plain English\n3. Test it in the playground\n4. Download the Python script that it generates\n5. Customize it if necessary in your IDE\n6. Deploy it\n\nYou can also integrate your automations with a human-in-the-loop step so you can intervene when judgment is required, such as solving a CAPTCHA or completing an authentication flow.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice:\n\n1. Hertz, the car rental company, automated manual test cases for their core rental flow. They say this accelerated their shipping velocity by 5x.\n\n2. Alvee Health automated its public benefits enrollment process. They expect this to increase the number of successful benefit registrations by 30%.\n\n3. PGA Tour automated its test suite to cover multiple geographies and time zones.\n\nThere's a huge opportunity right now to identify all the tasks we constantly do and automate them one by one.\n\nHere is a link to the Nova Act playground: https://t.co/5RFN5TX0A8\n\nThanks to Amazon for sponsoring this post.",

      "content": "I asked Grok: What is cherry picking?\n\nThe answer:\n\n**Cherry picking** refers to the practice of selectively choosing data, evidence, examples, or items that support a particular position or desired outcome, while ignoring or suppressing those that contradict it.\n\nThis term originates from the idea of harvesting cherries: a picker selects only the ripest, best ones, leading an observer to mistakenly assume all the fruit on the tree is equally good.\n\n### Primary Meanings\n1. **As a Logical Fallacy (Most Common in Arguments and Data Analysis)**:  \n   Known as the *fallacy of incomplete evidence*, *suppressed evidence*, or *card stacking*. It involves presenting only favorable evidence to persuade others, creating a biased or misleading impression.  \n   This is often linked to confirmation bias and is common in debates, science denial (e.g., climate change or evolution), politics, and media.  \n   **Example**: A climate skeptic highlights a few cold winter days to argue against global warming, ignoring long-term temperature data and scientific consensus showing rising trends.\n\n2. **Neutral or Positive Selection**:  \n   To carefully choose the best or most desirable items from a group (e.g., \"cherry-pick the top talent from applicants\" or \"cherry-pick stocks based on performance\").  \n   Dictionaries like Merriam-Webster and Cambridge define it this way, sometimes noting it can feel unfair if it disadvantages others.\n\n3. **Technical Uses**:  \n   - In Git (version control software): \"Cherry-picking\" a commit means applying changes from a specific commit on one branch to another, without merging everything.  \n   - In sports (e.g., basketball): Positioning near the opponent's goal to wait for an easy scoring opportunity.\n\nIn everyday discussion, especially around arguments, statistics, or debates, \"cherry picking\" usually carries a negative connotation, implying intellectual dishonesty or bias. To avoid it, consider all relevant evidence for a balanced view.",
